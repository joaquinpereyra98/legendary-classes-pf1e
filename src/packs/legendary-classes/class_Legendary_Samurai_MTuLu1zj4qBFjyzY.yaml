      <p>Few warriors are more dedicated to honor and the code of the warrior
      than the samurai. Trained from an early age in the art of war and sworn to
      the service of a lord, the samurai holds a position of power and respect
      in many lands, often serving as the voice and justice of the local noble.
      The samurai takes on his training with zeal, learning the way of the blade
      (typically a katana), the bow, and the horse. Some even learn how to
      effectively use firearms, if they are available. The samurai is often the
      most trusted soldier in his lord’s employ. In him, the common folk see
      honor and sacrifice. He is an honorable warrior, dedicated to the realm
      and the leaders that guide it.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> While
      typically sworn to the service of a lord, a samurai is usually given free
      reign as to how he performs that service. As such, samurai can sometimes
      be found with other adventurers, taking the fight to the enemies of their
      masters. Other samurai become ronin, striving to serve an ideal without
      paying fealty to a lord. In either case, samurai make powerful allies,
      capable of withstanding nearly any harm while dispatching their foes with
      deadly precision.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The samurai’s class skills
      are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal
      (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis),
      and Swim (Str).</p>
