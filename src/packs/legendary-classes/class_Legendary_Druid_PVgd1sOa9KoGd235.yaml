    value: >-
      <p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a
      power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these
      primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known
      as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often
      misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all
      who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock
      themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible
      powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the
      companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath.
      The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes
      with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by
      civilization.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: While some druids might keep to
      the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight
      while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into
      deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship
      personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself.
      Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as
      likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific
      awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The druid’s
      class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), <em>Handle
      Animal</em> (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge
      (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft
      (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
