      <p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury
      of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal
      souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques,
      they are not soldiers or professional warriors—they are the battle
      possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians,
      these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of
      warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before
      them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They
      possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all
      that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of
      life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such
      philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms
      the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their
      rage.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing
      the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior
      to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of
      most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all
      who would stand in their way.</p><h3><strong>Class
      Skills</strong></h3><p>The barbarian’s class skills are
      <em>Acrobatics</em> (<em>Dex</em>), <em>Climb</em> (<em>Str</em>),
      <em>Craft</em> (<em>Int</em>), <em>Handle Animal</em> (<em>Cha</em>),
      <em>Intimidate</em> (<em>Cha</em>), <em>Knowledge</em> (nature)
      (<em>Int</em>), <em>Perception</em> (<em>Wis</em>), <em>Ride</em>
      (<em>Dex</em>), <em>Survival</em> (<em>Wis</em>), and <em>Swim</em>
      (<em>Str</em>).</p>
