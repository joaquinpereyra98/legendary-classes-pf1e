      <p>While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their
      time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort
      dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers,
      swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are
      skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a
      battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering
      banner. The cavalier’s true power comes from the conviction of his ideals,
      the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he
      makes.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on
      the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the
      flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing
      their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is
      no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most
      delicate of social situations.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The cavalier’s
      class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),
      Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense
      Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
