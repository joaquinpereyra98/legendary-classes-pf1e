      <p>There are those who spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and
      texts, unlocking the power of magic, and there are those who spend their
      time perfecting the use of individual weapons, becoming masters without
      equal. The magus is at once a student of both philosophies, blending
      magical ability and martial prowess into something entirely unique, a
      discipline in which both spell and steel are used to devastating effect.
      As he grows in power, the magus unlocks powerful forms of arcana that
      allow him to merge his talents further, and at the pinnacle of his art,
      the magus becomes a blur of steel and magic, a force that few foes would
      dare to stand against.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Magi spend much of
      their time traveling the world, learning whatever martial or arcane
      secrets they can find. They might spend months learning a new
      sword-fighting style from a master warrior, while simultaneously
      moonlighting in the local library, poring through tomes of ancient lore.
      Most who take this path dabble in all sorts of lore, picking up anything
      that might aid them in their search for perfection.</p><h2>Class
      skills</h2><p>The magusâ€™s class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly
      (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge
      (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride
      (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and <em>Use Magic Device</em>
      (Cha).</p>
