      <p> While in a rage, a barbarian gains a +3 bonus on ranged attack and
      damage rolls, but only against targets within the first range increment of
      her attack. Against a target within 10 feet, the barbarian’s critical
      multiplier for damage increases by 1 (a ×2 multiplier becomes ×3, a ×3
      multiplier becomes ×4, and a ×4 multiplier becomes ×5). This critical
      multiplier increase does not stack with other effects which increase
      critical multipliers. While raging, the barbarian doubles her attack
      penalty due to range increments. </p> <p> <i>Greater Close Quarters Rage

      take the –2 penalty to her Armor Class for being in rage against attacks
      made by the target of her challenge. If the target of the challenge is
      killed, the barbarian exits her rage. The challenge ends when the
      barbarian exits the rage. </p> <p> <i>Greater Dueling Rage (Ex):</i> At
