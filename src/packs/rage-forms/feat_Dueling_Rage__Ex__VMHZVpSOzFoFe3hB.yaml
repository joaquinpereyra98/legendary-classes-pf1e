      <p> When a barbarian enters a rage, she chooses one target within sight to
      challenge. While in a rage, she gains a +3 bonus on attack rolls and
      damage rolls against the target of her challenge. The barbarian does not
      take the –2 penalty to her Armor Class for being in rage against attacks
      made by the target of her challenge. If the target of the challenge is
      killed, the barbarian exits her rage. The challenge ends when the
      barbarian exits the rage. </p> <p> <i>Greater Dueling Rage (Ex):</i> At
      11th level, a barbarian’s bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against
      the target of her challenge increases to +4. </p> <p> <i>Mighty Dueling
      Rage (Ex):</i> At 20th level, a barbarian’s bonus on attack rolls and
      damage rolls against the target of her challenge increases to +5. </p>

      id="Elemental_Rage_(Su)">Elemental Rage (Su)</span> </h2> <p> When a
      barbarian enters a rage, she chooses an energy type (acid, cold,
      electricity, or fire). While in a rage, she gains an elemental aura of the
      chosen energy type. Creatures within five feet of the barbarian at start
      of her turn take 1d6 points of energy damage of the selected type. The
      barbarian’s attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of the
      selected type. </p> <p> <i>Greater Elemental Rage (Su):</i> At 11th level,
      a barbarian’s elemental aura deals 2d6 points of energy damage. </p> <p>
      <i>Mighty Elemental Rage (Su):</i> At 20th level, a barbarian’s elemental
      aura deals 4d6 points of energy damage. </p> <h2> <span

      id="Enlarging_Rage_(Su)">Enlarging Rage (Su)</span> </h2> <p> While in a
      rage, a barbarian’s size increases by one size category. The barbarian
      gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a
      minimum of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to her
      increased size. A Medium humanoid barbarian whose size increases to Large
      has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. All equipment worn
      or carried by the barbarian is similarly enlarged by the spell. Enlarging
      rage is a supernatural ability which otherwise acts like <i>enlarge
      person</i>. Unlike most rage forms, entering an enlarging rage is a
      standard action. </p> <p> <i>Greater Enlarging Rage (Su):</i> At 11th
      level, a barbarian’s size increases by two size categories while raging.
      The barbarian gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, and takes a –4 size
      penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC because of
      its increased size. A Medium humanoid barbarian whose size increases to
      Huge has a space of 15 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. </p> <p>
      <i>Mighty Enlarging Rage (Su):</i> At 20th level, a barbarian’s size
      increases by three size categories while raging. The barbarian gains a +6
      size bonus to Strength, and takes a –6 size penalty to Dexterity and a –4
      penalty on attack rolls and to AC because of its increased size. A Medium
      humanoid barbarian whose size increases to Gargantuan has a space of 20
      feet and a natural reach of 15 feet. </p> <h2> <span

      rage, a barbarian gains damage reduction and resist against all energy
      attacks equal to half her barbarian level (minimum 1). This damage
      reduction and energy resistance stack with other damage reduction or
      energy resistance gained from class abilities or rage powers. She also
      gains a +3 bonus on all Fortitude and Reflex Saves. </p> <p> <i>Greater
