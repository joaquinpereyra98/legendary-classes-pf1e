      <p> While in a rage, a barbarian’s size increases by one size category.
      The barbarian gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size penalty to
      Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due
      to her increased size. A Medium humanoid barbarian whose size increases to
      Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. All equipment
      worn or carried by the barbarian is similarly enlarged by the spell.

      <i>enlarge person</i>. Unlike most rage forms, entering an enlarging rage
      is a standard action. </p> <p> <i>Greater Enlarging Rage (Su):</i> At 11th
