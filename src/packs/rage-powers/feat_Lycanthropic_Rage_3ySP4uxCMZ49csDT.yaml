  description:
    value: >-
      <p> While using her animal rage form or bestial rage form, the barbarian
      is immune to lycanthropy and gains DR/silver equal to half her barbarian
      level, and her natural weapons and unarmed strikes are treated as silver
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. She does not actually
      become a lycanthrope or inflict lycanthropy. </p> <p> A barbarian must
      have the animal rage form or bestial rage form and be at least 10th level
      to select this rage power. </p>
