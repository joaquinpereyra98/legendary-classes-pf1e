  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending three rounds of rage, the barbarian can avoid serious harm
      from an attack. She attempts a Fortitude save with a DC equal to the
      damage that would be dealt by the attack. If she succeeds, she takes no
      damage from the attack. If she fails, she takes half damage from the
      attack and the damage is nonlethal. The barbarian must elect to use this
      ability after the attack roll is made, but before the damage is rolled.
      </p> <p>A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage
      power.</p>
