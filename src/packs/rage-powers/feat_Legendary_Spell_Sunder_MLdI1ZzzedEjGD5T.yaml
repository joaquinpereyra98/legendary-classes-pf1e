    value: >-
      <p> By spending one round of rage, the barbarian can attempt to sunder an
      ongoing spell effect by succeeding at a combat maneuver check. For any
      effect other than one on a creature, the barbarian must make her combat
      maneuver check against a CMD of 15 plus the effect’s caster level. To
      sunder an effect on a creature, the barbarian must succeed at a normal
      sunder combat maneuver against the creature’s CMD + 10. If successful, the
      effect is dispelled. </p> <p> A barbarian must have the witch hunter rage
      power to select this rage power. </p> <p> <b>Legendary Bloody Fist
      (Ex):</b> By spending one round of rage, the barbarian may attempt to
      punch through an opponent’s flesh and rip out one of its vital organs.
      When the barbarian confirms a critical hit against an opponent with a
      natural attack or unarmed strike, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude
      save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s class level + the barbarian’s Strength
      modifier) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as one of its vital
      organs is ripped free from its body. A barbarian must be at least 12th
      level to select this rage power. </p>
