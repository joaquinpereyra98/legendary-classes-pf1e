  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending two rounds of rage as a standard action, the barbarian
      heals 1d8 points of damage + her Constitution modifier. For every 4 levels
      the barbarian has beyond 4th, the amount healed increases by 1d8 (to a
      maximum of 5d8 at 20th level). </p> <p>The barbarian must be at least 4th
      level to select this rage power.</p> <p> <b>Anarchic Fist (Su):</b> The
      barbarianâ€™s unarmed strike and any natural weapons are considered magic
      weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, with the anarchic
      property (dealing 2d6 points of additional damage to lawful creatures).
      Melee weapons she wields are similarly treated as magical and deal 1d6
      points of additional damage to lawful creatures. </p> <p> A barbarian must
      have the greater chaos totem power and be at least 16th level to select
      this rage power. </p>
