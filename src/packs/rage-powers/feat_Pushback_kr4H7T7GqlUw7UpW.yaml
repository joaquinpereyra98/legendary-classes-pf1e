  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When a creature attempts a bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun,
      reposition, or trip combat maneuver against the barbarian and fails the
      check, she can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that creature
      as an immediate action or by spending an attack of opportunity. A
      barbarian must have the knockback rage power to select this rage power.
