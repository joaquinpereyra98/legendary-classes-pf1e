  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending one round of rage, a barbarian can use a move action to
      grant all allies within 10 feet the Diehard feat and immunity to fear for
      a number of rounds equal to the barbarian’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
      In addition, any ally affected by this ability reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points automatically stabilizes and also gains temporary hit points equal
      to the barbarian’s class level. These temporary hit points dissipate after
      1 minute if not expended. </p> <p> A barbarian must have the battlecry
      rage power and be at least 12th level to select this rage power. </p>
