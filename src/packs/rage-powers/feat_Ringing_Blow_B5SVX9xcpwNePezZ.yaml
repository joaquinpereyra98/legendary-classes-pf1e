    value: >-
      <p> When the barbarian hits with an attack, she can spend two rounds of
      rage to deal 1 point of ability damage to the targetâ€™s Charisma,
      Intelligence, or Wisdom score. This damage increases by 1 point for every
      4 levels the barbarian has. </p> <p>A barbarian must be at least 8th level
      to select this rage power.</p> <p> <b>Savagery (Ex):</b> When the
      barbarian confirm a critical hit, the duration of her current rage is
      increased by 1 round after she stop spending rounds of rage to continue
      it. This is increased by 1 additional round when wielding a weapon with a
      x3 critical multiplier, or by 2 rounds if using a weapon with a x4
      critical multiplier. These extra rounds of rage stack with each other. The
      barbarian may choose to end her rage before these additional rounds of
      rage are expended, but any extra rounds unused when she ends her rage are
      wasted. She does not gain additional rounds of rage for critical hits
      against creatures whose Hit Dice are less than one-half her own. </p> <p>A
      barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
