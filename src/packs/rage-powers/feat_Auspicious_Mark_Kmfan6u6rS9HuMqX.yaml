  description:
    value: >-
      <p> The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an
      impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark she possesses. By spending two
      rounds of rage as a swift action, she can call upon the spiritsâ€™ favor to
      increase any d20 roll she just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the
      result. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels she has. She can call
      on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll. </p>
