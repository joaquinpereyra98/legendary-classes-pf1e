  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending four rounds of rage as swift action, the barbarian can
      summon animals as if casting summon nature’s allies VII. She uses her
      barbarian level as her druid level. The summoned creatures disappear when
      the rage ends, when the spell’s duration ends naturally, or if the
      barbarian summons additional creatures using any beastlord totem. </p> <p>
      The barbarian must have the beastlord totem [Greater] rage power and be
      14th level to select this rage power. </p>
