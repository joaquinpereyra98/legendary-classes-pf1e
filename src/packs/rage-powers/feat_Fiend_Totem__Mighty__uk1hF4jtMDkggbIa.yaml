  description:
    value: >-
      <p> The barbarian gains the ability to smite good. By spending two rounds
      of rage as a swift action, the barbarian chooses one target within sight
      to smite. If this target is good, the barbarian adds her Charisma bonus
      (if any) to attack rolls and gains a damage bonus equal to her HD against
      that foe. This effect persists until the barbarian hits the creature with
      an attack or the barbarianâ€™s rage ends. </p> <p> A barbarian must have the
      fiend totem [Greater] rage power and be 14th level to select this rage
      power. </p>
