  description:
    value: >-
      <p> The barbarian can sense the presence of incorporeal undead as though
      she had the scent ability—even if the undead is within a solid object or
      behind a solid barrier—and can track incorporeal undead by scent using the
      Survival skill, with a bonus on such checks equal to her barbarian level.
      She adds half her barbarian level on Perception checks made against
      incorporeal undead creatures, and when she readies an action to attack an
      incorporeal creature she can move up to one-half her speed as part of that
      readied action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from
      incorporeal undead creatures, though it does from other creatures. If she
      does not move as part of the readied action, she instead can make her
      readied attack with a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls for
      every 4 barbarian levels. </p> <p> A barbarian must have the ghost rager
      rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power. </p>
