  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending two rounds of rage, the barbarian can absorb the energy
      from a single attack that deals damage of the energy type she resists with
      the energy resistance rage power. She takes no damage from the attack and
      doesn’t attempt a saving throw. Instead, she increases the temporary hit
      points from her rage by an amount equal to 1/2 the damage she would have
      taken (ignoring her energy resistance). </p> <p> If the barbarian is at
      least 16th level, once before her rage ends, she can unleash the stored
      energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. The
      breath weapon deals an amount of damage equal to the full amount the
      barbarian would have taken from the absorbed effect. Creatures affected by
      the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2
      the barbarian’s level + her Constitution modifier). She retains the
      temporary hit points from this ability even if she unleashes this breath
      weapon. </p> <p> A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power
      and be at least 12th level to select this rage power. </p>
