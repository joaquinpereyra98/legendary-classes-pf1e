  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending two rounds of rage, the barbarian expels a breath weapon
      as a standard action, inflicting damage of the same type as her totem
      dragon. This breath takes the shape of a 30-foot cone (gold, green, red,
      silver, white) or 60-foot line (black, blue, brass, bronze, copper) and
      deals 1d6 points of damage per barbarian level. A Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2
      the barbarianâ€™s level + her Constitution modifier) halves this damage.
      </p> <p> A barbarian must have the dragon totem wings rage power and be at
      least 14th level to select this rage power. </p>
