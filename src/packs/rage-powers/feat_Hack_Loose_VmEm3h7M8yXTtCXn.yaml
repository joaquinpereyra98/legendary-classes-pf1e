  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When the barbarian strikes a creature in melee that is grappling
      another creature (including a creature that has swallowed a target whole),
      the grappled or swallowed creature can attempt a grapple combat maneuver
      check as an immediate action to break free. The barbarianâ€™s attack must
      deal at least 5 points of damage from a single attack to a Medium or
      smaller creature, plus an additional 5 points for every size larger than
      Medium, in order to allow a grappled creature to break free. The trapped
      creature gains a +1 bonus on this check for every 5 additional points of
      damage beyond this threshold. The barbarian can use this rage power to
      grant herself the opportunity to break free from a creature grappling her.
