    value: >-
      <p> The barbarianâ€™s bloodlust allows him to perceive some enemies with
      perfect accuracy. The barbarian ignores the concealment, total
      concealment, and invisibility of enemies below full health who have blood
      (typically all creatures besides constructs, oozes, plants, and
      incorporeal creatures). </p> <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to
      select this rage power.</p>
