  description:
    value: >-
      <p> The barbarian’s weapons can tear open reality itself. When the
      barbarian confirms a critical hit on an enemy, the enemy momentarily sees
      the full truth of the dark tapestry between stars. It must make a
      Willpower save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s class level + the
      barbarian’s Strength modifier) or become confused for one round. </p> <p>
      The barbarian must have the void totem [Lesser] rage power and be 6th
      level to select this rage power. </p>
