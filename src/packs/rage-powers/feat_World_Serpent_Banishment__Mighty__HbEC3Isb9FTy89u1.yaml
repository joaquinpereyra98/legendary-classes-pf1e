  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Whenever a barbarian confirms a critical strike against an outsider or
      aberration, the barbarian may spend 1 round of rage to subject the
      creature to a <i>banishment</i>, using her barbarian level as the caster
      level (DC = 10 + ½ barbarian’s level + barbarian’s Constitution modifier).
      </p> <p> A barbarian must have the world serpent totem unity rage power
      and be 14th level to select this rage power. </p>
