  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When using her limb ripper rage power, the barbarian can attempt to
      tear off the head of the target instead of one of its limbs. If the sunder
      combat maneuver succeeds, any bite or gore attack made by the target is
      considered broken, suffering a â€“2 penalty to attack and damage rolls. If
      the sunder combat maneuver check exceeds the DC by 10 or more and the
      target fails its Fortitude save, its head is severed from its body. Most
      creatures are killed instantly. Creatures with multiple heads lose the use
      of the severed head and suffer bleed damage as normal for the limb ripper
      rage power. </p> <p> A barbarian must be at least 16th level and have the
      limb ripper rage power to select this rage power </p>
