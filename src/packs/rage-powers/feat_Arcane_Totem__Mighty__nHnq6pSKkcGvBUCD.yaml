  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Anytime a harmless spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within 30 feet
      of the barbarian, she may choose to immediately gain the benefit of that
      spell as if it had also targeted her. She may only gain this benefit if
      she is aware of the spell being cast. The intended target still gains the
      effect of the spell. The duration of the effect on the barbarian ends when
      her rage ends. </p> <p> The barbarian must have the arcane totem rage
      [Greater] power and be 14th level to select this rage power. </p>
