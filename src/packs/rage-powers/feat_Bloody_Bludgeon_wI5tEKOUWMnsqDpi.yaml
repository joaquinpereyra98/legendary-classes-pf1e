  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When severing an opponentâ€™s limb with her limb ripper rage power, the
      barbarian can use the severed limb as an improvised weapon (of the same
      size as the creature whose limb it was) for the remainder of her current
      rage. She takes no attack roll penalties for using an improvised weapon or
      a weapon of the wrong size, and she gains a morale bonus to attack and
      damage rolls equal to one quarter her barbarian level. This bonus is
      doubled against the creature whose limb it was. </p> <p> A barbarian must
      have the limb ripper rage power and be at least 16th level to select this
      rage power. </p>
