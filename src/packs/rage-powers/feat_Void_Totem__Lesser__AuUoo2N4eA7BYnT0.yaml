  description:
    value: >-
      <p> : A protective shield of warped gravity appears around the barbarian.
      This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each
      ranged attack directed at the barbarian for which the attacker must make
      an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of
      concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not
      affected. </p>
