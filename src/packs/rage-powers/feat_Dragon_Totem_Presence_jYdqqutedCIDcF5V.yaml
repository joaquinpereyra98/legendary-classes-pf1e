  description:
    value: >-
      <p> The barbarian takes on the appearance of a terrifying dragon. The
      barbarian may emit a roar as part of an attack or charge which affects all
      opponents within 30 feet. An opponent can resist the effects with a
      successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s
      Charisma modifier). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is
      immune to that same creature’s frightful presence for 24 hours. On a
      failed save, the opponent is shaken for 2d6 rounds, or panicked for 2d6
      rounds if it has 4 Hit Dice or fewer. This is a mind-affecting fear
      effect. </p> <p> A barbarian must have the dragon totem wings rage power
      and be 14th level to select this rage power. </p>
