  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Whenever the barbarian scores a critical hit with a slashing or
      piercing weapon, her opponent takes 1d6 points of bleed damage each round
      on her turn, in addition to the damage dealt by the critical hit. This
      bleed damage can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal skill check or through any
      magical healing. The effects of this rage power stack. </p>
