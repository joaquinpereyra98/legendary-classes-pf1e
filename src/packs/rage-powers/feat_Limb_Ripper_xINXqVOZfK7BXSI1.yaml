  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When a target fails its saving throw against the barbarian’s crippling
      blow rage power, the barbarian can attempt to tear off one of the target’s
      limbs (including arms, legs, wings, tail, or tentacles) with a sunder
      combat maneuver against the target’s CMD. If the sunder combat maneuver
      succeeds, one of the target’s limbs chosen by the barbarian is broken. Any
      attacks made using that limb take a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
      A broken limb used for locomotion decreases the target’s speed by half and
      the creature cannot run or charge. Only legs or tail can be targeted with
      this rage power if the target is more than one size category larger than
      the barbarian; however, arms or wings can be targeted if the barbarian
      readies an action to use this ability when attacked by such appendages. A
      broken limb can be healed with regenerate, heal, or succeeding on Heal
      checks to provide long-term care on at least three consecutive days. In
      addition, if the barbarian exceeds the target DC by 10 or more, the target
      must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + her
      Strength modifier). If this save fails, the limb is not merely broken but
      severed entirely. The target can no longer use the limb and takes 1d6
      bleed damage per round. A severed limb can be restored with regenerate.
      </p> <p> A barbarian must have the crippling blow rage power and be at
      least 12th level to select this rage power. </p>
