  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending one round of rage, the barbarian can make a disarm attempt
      against a target in place of a melee attack. This attempt does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. If successful, the barbarian sends the target’s
      weapon flying—either straight at the target, or spinning away to strike
      another foe up to 20 feet away. </p> <p> This ranged attack counts as
      throwing a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown, even if the weapon
      disarmed is a thrown weapon. </p> <p> The barbarian makes a ranged attack,
      which doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, at either the target of his
      disarm maneuver or another creature within 20 feet. If the barbarian is
      aiming for the disarmed creature, the foe doesn’t count as being in melee
      for determining any penalty on the ranged attack from throwing a ranged
      weapon into melee. If the ranged attack hits, the disarmed weapon deals
      damage as if the barbarian had thrown it. </p> <p> The barbarian can
      choose to aim the disarmed weapon at a square rather than at a foe. </p>
      <p>A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
