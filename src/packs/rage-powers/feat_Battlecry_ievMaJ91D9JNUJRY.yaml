    value: >-
      <p> By spending one round of rage, the barbarian can unleash an inspiring
      battlecry as a swift action. Allies within 60 feet of the barbarian gain a
      +1 morale bonus on melee damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to the
      barbarianâ€™s Constitution modifier. This bonus increases by +1 for every 6
      levels the barbarian has attained. </p>
