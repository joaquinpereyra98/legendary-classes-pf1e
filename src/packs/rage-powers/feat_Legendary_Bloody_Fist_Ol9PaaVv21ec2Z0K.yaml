  description:
    value: >-
      <p> By spending one round of rage, the barbarian may attempt to punch
      through an opponent’s flesh and rip out one of its vital organs. When the
      barbarian confirms a critical hit against an opponent with a natural
      attack or unarmed strike, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save
      (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s class level + the barbarian’s Strength
      modifier) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as one of its vital
      organs is ripped free from its body. A barbarian must be at least 12th
      level to select this rage power. </p>
