  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, whenever an alchemist creates a bomb, they can create two bombs, being able to attack with both as a part of their attack action. This second bomb takes a -5 penalty to its attack roll, is not treated as an attack action, and the alchemist cannot apply a substance discovery to this bomb.</p>
