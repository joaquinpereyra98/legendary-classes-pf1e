  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an alchemist gains a
      competence bonus equal to their class level on the Craft (alchemy) check. In
      addition, an alchemist can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using
      <i>detect magic</i>. They must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a
      check. In addition, whenever an alchemist uses an alchemical item as a weapon
      or otherwise, its DC is increased to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the
      alchemist’s Intelligence modifier (unless it would normally be higher). An
      alchemist can draw alchemical items (such as alchemist’s fire) as a part of
      making an attack with them, rather than requiring a move action to do so.</p>
      <p>An alchemist can spend 1 point of quintessence as a swift action to cause an
      alchemical item to deal an additional die of damage (an alchemist fire would
      deal 2d6 damage, while bottled lightning would deal 2d8 damage), this effect
      lasts until the end of the alchemist’s next turn. At 5th level and every five
      levels afterwards, whenever the alchemist spends quintessence for this
      ability, they increase the damage by an additional damage die, up to a maximum
      of five additional damage dice at 20th level.</p>
