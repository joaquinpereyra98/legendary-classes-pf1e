    value: >-
      <p> Each domain has one spell at each spell level. A cleric can channel
      stored spell energy to cast these spells any time. The cleric can "lose"
      any prepared spell that is not an orison in order to cast any domain spell
      of the same spell level or lower. </p> <p> <b>Blessing of the Faith
      (Su):</b> At 2nd level, the cleric gains one of the following feats as a
      bonus feat: Celestial Obedience, Deific Obedience,  Fey Obedience,
      Fiendish Obedience, Monitor Obedience. They need not meet the skill
      prerequisites but must worship the requisite entity. At 6th level (or 8th
      level if they select a feat other than Deific Obedience), they gain the
      benefits of the first boon offered by their faith, selecting between the
      Evangelist, Exalted, and Sentinel boons at this level (these determine all
      other boons the cleric receives). At 10th level (or 12th level if they
      select a feat other than Deific Obedience), they gain the benefits of the
      second boon, and at 14th level (or 16th level if they select a feat other
      than Deific Obedience) they gain the third boon. </p> <p> If the cleric
      does not worship an entity or worships an entity without listed bonuses
      for one of these feats (or if they don't like any of the presented options
      for their deity), they may instead choose to receive a +1 sacred bonus to
      skill checks with a single skill at 2nd level. This bonus improves by 1 at
      6th level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 6th level, 10th level, and
      14th level, the cleric chooses one of the following types of rolls for
      this sacred bonus to also apply to: attack rolls, concentration checks,
      caster level checks, or skill checks with a different skill. </p>
