  description:
    value: >-
      <p> A cleric's power is drawn from their faith, a deep and powerful belief
      in a greater power or meaning. This may take the form of a deity or
      pantheon, spirits, ancestor worship, a deep reverence of nature, or any
      other religious or spiritual belief. A cleric's alignment must be
      appropriate to their religion; if they worship a deity, their alignment
      must be within one step of that deity's. Otherwise, they should choose an
      alignment which reflects the values of their faith. </p> <p> At 1st level,
      the cleric's faith manifests itself in a pool of points which fuel their
      domain powers. The cleric's faith pool is equal to 1/2 their level plus
      their Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). When casting a spell, they can expend 1
      point of faith to increase their effective caster level by 1 or increase
      the DC of the spell by 1. The cleric regains all expended faith when they
      regain spells each day. </p>
