  description:
    value: >-
      <p> A cleric automatically gains a number of ranks in Knowledge (religion)
      equal to their class level and may use Wisdom in place of Intelligence for
      Knowledge (religion) checks. In addition, they automatically succeed at
      any Knowledge check related to their faith, though if it isn't about their
      faith specifically (for instance, a story about a different deity that
      theirs is involved in), they only know the parts that involve their faith.
