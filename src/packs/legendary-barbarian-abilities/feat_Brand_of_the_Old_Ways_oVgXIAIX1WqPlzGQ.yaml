      </p> <p><b>Benefit:</b> A barbarian with this brand increases her maximum
      daily rounds   of rage by 1 round of rage for every 4 barbarian levels.
      </p> <p>   <b>Special:</b> When a barbarian gains a level, she may choose
      to remove this   brand from her body. If she does, she can never gain it
      again. </p>
