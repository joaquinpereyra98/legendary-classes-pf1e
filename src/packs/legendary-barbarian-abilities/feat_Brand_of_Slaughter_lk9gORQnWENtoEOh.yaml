  description:
    value: >-
      <p> The barbarian must seek out death as a means to resolve conflict. If
      her rage ends before she has killed a creature with a HD at least half her
      own (minimum 1), then she breaks this brand. </p> <p> <b>Benefit:</b> A
      barbarian with this brand increases her maximum daily rounds of rage by 1
      round of rage per barbarian level. </p> <p> <b>Redemption:</b> The
      barbarian must slay a surrendered, helpless enemy of her own race and
      alignment. </p>
