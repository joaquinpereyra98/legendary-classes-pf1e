  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Violence solves all problems. Words are for the weak. If a barbarian
      speaks or otherwise communicates while in a rage, then she breaks this
      brand. Wordlessly intimidating enemies or roaring in anger does not break
      this brand. </p> <p> <b>Benefit:</b> A barbarian with this brand increases
      her maximum daily rounds of rage by 1 round of rage for every 3 barbarian
      levels. </p> <p> <b>Redemption:</b> The barbarian must go one week without
      speaking or communicating in any way. </p>
