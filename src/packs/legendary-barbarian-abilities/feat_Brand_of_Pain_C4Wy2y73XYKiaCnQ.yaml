  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Life is pain. The barbarian understands that better than most. If the
      barbarian is at her maximum hit points when her rage ends, then she breaks
      this brand. </p> <p> <b>Benefit:</b> A barbarian with this brand increases
      her maximum daily rounds of rage by 1 round of rage for every 4 barbarian
      levels. </p> <p> <b>Redemption:</b> The barbarian must spend 24 hours with
      fewer than 5 hit points remaining. </p>
