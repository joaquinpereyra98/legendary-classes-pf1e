  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength andferocity,
      granting her additional combat prowess. At 1st level, a barbariancan rage
      for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitutionmodifier. For
      each level after 1st she possesses, the barbarian can rage for 1additional
      round per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as thatgained
      from <i>bear's endurance</i>, do not increase the total number ofrounds
      that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter a rage as afree
      action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed afterresting
      for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p><p>While in
      a rage, a barbarian gains the benefits of her rage form and a +4bonus on
      Will saves against fear effects but takes a â€“2 penalty to her ArmorClass.
      She also gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. At 11th level
      thisincreases to 3 temporary hit points per level, and at 20th level
      thisincreases to 4 temporary hit points per level. These temporary hit
      points arelost first when a character takes damage, disappear when the
      rage ends, andare not replenished if the barbarian enters a rage again
      within 1 minute ofher previous rage.</p><p>While in a rage, a barbarian
      cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, orIntelligence-based skill (except
      Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or anyability that requires
      patience or concentration (such as spellcasting).</p><p>A barbarian can
      end her rage as a free action and is fatigued for 1 minuteafter a rage
      ends. A barbarian can't enter a new rage while fatigued orexhausted but
      can otherwise enter a rage multiple times per day. If abarbarian falls
      unconscious, her rage immediately ends.</p><p>Spells, feats, and abilities
      which grant extra rounds of rage only grant thelegendary barbarian half as
      many rounds of rage as normal (minimum 1). TheExtra Rage feat grants three
      rounds of rage instead of six.</p>
