  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 8th level, you can quickly respond to your allies in danger. As an
      immediate action when an ally would be hit by an attack, you can spend 1
      point of faith to grant them a +2 sacred bonus to armor class and
      temporary hp equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier for one round. If
      the attack would miss their new armor class, it is negated. </p>
