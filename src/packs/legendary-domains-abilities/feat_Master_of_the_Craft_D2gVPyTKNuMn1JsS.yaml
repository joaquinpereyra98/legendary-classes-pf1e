    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level you gain Master Craftsman as a bonus feat. You can craft
      any magic item even if you do not have the feat required to do so,
      although you must meet that feat’s prerequisites. If you do not have the
      feat to craft the item, the cost of crafting the item is increased by 50%
      (to 75% of the item’s normal market price). </p>
