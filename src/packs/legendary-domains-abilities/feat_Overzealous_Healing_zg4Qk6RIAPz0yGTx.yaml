  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level, healing energy in excess of what you need can be
      converted into a barrier to protect your allies. You can spend 1 point of
      faith when casting a spell of the healing subdomain or channeling to heal;
      any healing in excess of their maximum hp becomes temporary hp that lasts
      for 1 hour. </p>
