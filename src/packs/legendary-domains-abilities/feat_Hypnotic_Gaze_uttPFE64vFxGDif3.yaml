      <p> At 8th level, you learn to harness the natural mind-altering powers
      many scalykind possess. As a standard action, you can spend 1 point of
      faith to fascinate a single creature for 1 round (Will negates). This
      fascination is only broken if the target is dealt damage. </p> <p></p>
