  description:
    value: >-
      <p> As a standard action, you can spend 1 point of faith to exude an aura
      of good luck. All allies within a 30â€™ radius gain a +1 luck bonus on
      attack rolls and saving throws for one round. At 13th level and 18th level
      this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +3. This aura can be
      maintained each round as a free action, but costs 1 point of faith each
      round. </p> <p></p>
