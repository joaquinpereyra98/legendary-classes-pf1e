    value: >-
      <p> By spending a faith point as an immediate action, you may grant an
      ally within 30 feet a sacred bonus to Acrobatics checks, Escape Artist
      checks, CMD, and saving throws against effects which would restrict their
      movement for 1 round. This bonus is equal to half your cleric level
      (minimum 2). </p>
