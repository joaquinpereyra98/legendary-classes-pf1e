    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 16th level, your knightly presence inspires others to
      break free of their shackles. Whenever you use your inspiring command, all
      affected creatures gain a new save against all negative effects affecting
      them. A creature can only benefit from this ability once per minute. </p>
