  description:
    value: >-
      <p> You become aware of all animals within a 100-foot radius of you at all
      times. As a full round action, you can spend 3 points of faith to call a
      nearby animal to aid you. This animal becomes an animal companion to you,
      using your level as your druid level to determine their statistics but
      gaining no feats for their hit dice. Available companions vary based on
      your environment. The companion will only stay with you for the duration
      of the task you have for it, although this task can be as open ended as
      “accompany me through this dungeon.” </p>
