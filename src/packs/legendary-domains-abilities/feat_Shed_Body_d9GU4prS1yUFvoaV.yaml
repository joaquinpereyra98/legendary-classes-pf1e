  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you may become incorporeal as a move action and remain
      incorporeal as long as you wish. You may choose to have your equipment
      become incorporeal with you. Unlike other incorporeal creatures, you do
      not gain a deflection bonus to Armor Class from your Charisma modifier.
      During this time, your body fades into an immaterial form that retains
      your basic likeness. While incorporeal, you gain a fly speed equal to your
      land speed (perfect maneuverability). </p>
