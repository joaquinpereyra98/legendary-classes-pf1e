    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, the plants you conjure all bloom with delicate flowers
      that release a soothing scent. When you cast a plant domain spell, you can
      spend 1 point of faith to infuse these flowers with healing energy. Allies
      within the radius of the spell gain fast healing equal to your Wisdom
      modifier for the duration of the spell. </p>
