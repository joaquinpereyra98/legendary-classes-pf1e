    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, your words can completely bend someone to your will. As
      a standard action, you can spend 1 point of faith to control a creature
      within close range as per dominate person, save that it affects them
      regardless of creature type. This is a mind-affecting effect and the
      target is allowed a Will saving throw to resist it. The effect lasts only
      one minute per cleric level you possess. You cannot affect more than one
      target at a time, and regardless of whether they save they cannot be
      affected by this ability again for 24 hours. </p>
