    value: >-
      <p> Your blessed might allows you to overcome even tremendous foes. You
      may ignore any size bonuses to CMB or CMD that creatures possess and may
      perform combat maneuvers on creatures regardless of their size. When you
      succeed at a combat maneuver, you are treated as having succeeded by 5
      more for the purpose of determining the maneuverâ€™s effects. </p>
