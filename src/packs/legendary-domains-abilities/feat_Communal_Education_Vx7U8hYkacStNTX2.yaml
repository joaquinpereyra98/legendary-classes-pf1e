      <p> The greatest teachers donâ€™t simply tell others the answers but teach
      them to find the answers themselves. At 16th level, when you successfully
      roll a Knowledge check, you can spend 1 point of faith to allow all of
      your allies to make the same check, even if they are untrained. For every
      result which equals or exceeds 10, you gain a +2 bonus to your check. This
      can increase the bonus from identify weakness as normal. </p>
