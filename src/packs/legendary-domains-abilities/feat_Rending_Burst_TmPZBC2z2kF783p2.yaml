  description:
    value: >-
      <p> The radius of your explosive strike increases to 15 feet. When you use
      your explosive strike, you may make a single sunder attempt against one
      item of your choice per two cleric levels within the explosion. You may
      use your cleric level in place of your BAB and your Wisdom modifier in
      place of Strength when calculating your CMB for such maneuvers. If you
      succeed, that item also takes the damage from explosive strike. </p>
