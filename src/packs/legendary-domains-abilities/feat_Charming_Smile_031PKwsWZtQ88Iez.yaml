    value: >-
      <p> At 8th level you can spend 1 point of faith to cast charm person on a
      single target as a swift action. This does not benefit from honeyed words,
      but the target does not gain benefits for being in combat or hostile
      allies. If the target fails, they treat you and all of your allies as
      friendly. You can only affect one target at a time with this effect; if
      you use it again, the previous target is no longer affected. </p>
