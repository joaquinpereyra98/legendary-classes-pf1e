      <p> At 16th level, you’ve found countless tricks and techniques that let
      you cut costs without cutting quality. When crafting magic items, reduce
      the cost by 50% (to 25% of the item’s normal market price) if you have the
      appropriate feat. If you do not have the requisite item creation feats,
      you no longer increase the cost of crafting. </p>
