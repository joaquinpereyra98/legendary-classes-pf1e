  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When using dimensional hop, you may spend a faith point to create two
      5-foot diameter portals, one in the space you teleported from and one in
      your current space. These portals persist until the end of your next turn,
      and creatures of any size can step move through either, using 5 feet of
      movement to exit from the other portal. At the end of your next turn, you
      can spend an additional faith point as a free action to extend the
      portalsâ€™ duration by 1 round. </p>
