  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 16th level, you can spend 1 point of faith and a use of
      channel as a standard action to sap the energy from creatures around you.
      Enemies within 30 feet of you must make a Will save against your channel
      DC. Living creatures who fail become fatigued, and undead creatures become
      staggered for the duration of the Turn Undead effect. A living creature
      who is already fatigued instead falls asleep, while an undead creature who
      is already staggered becomes paralyzed, even if they would be immune to
      paralysis. </p>
