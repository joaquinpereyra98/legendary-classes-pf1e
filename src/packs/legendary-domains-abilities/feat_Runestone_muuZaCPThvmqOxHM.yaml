  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When you cast a spell that affects a specific area, such as
      consecrate, you can spend 1 point of faith to bind the spell to a rune
      instead of a location. This rune can be engraved on a stone, woven into
      clothing, or tattooed into your skin. The area of the spell becomes
      centered around the rune and moves with it. If the spell’s duration is
      greater than a day, then you do not regain the faith you spent on this
      ability until the spell’s duration ends. </p>
