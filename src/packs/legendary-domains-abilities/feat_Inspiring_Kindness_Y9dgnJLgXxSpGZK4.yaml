  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level, when you cast a harmless spell with a clearly beneficial
      effect such as a healing spell on a willing NPC you can spend 1 point of
      faith as a free action to increase their attitude by one step. You can
      only benefit from this effect once per day per NPC. If the target is
      already helpful, or is a PC, you instead give them a sacred bonus on saves
      against mindaffecting effects equal to the spellâ€™s level for its duration,
      or for one minute if the duration is instantaneous. </p>
