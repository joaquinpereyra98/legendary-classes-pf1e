    value: >-
      <p> You gain either the telekinetic blast or gravity blast wild talent and
      the kinetic blast class feature, treating half your cleric level as your
      kineticist level (minimum 1) and your Wisdom modifier as your Constitution
      modifier. You also gain either the basic telekinesis or basic chaokinesis
      utility wild talent. You can spend 1 point of faith as a free action to
      treat your cleric level as your kineticist level for one round instead.
