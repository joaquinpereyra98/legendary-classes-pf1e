    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, your fire becomes incredibly intense. When you cast a
      spell that deals fire damage you can spend 1 point of faith to increase
      its maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels (only for the fire damage),
      and its damage is increased by 50%. </p> <p> This ability stacks with the
      Intensify Spell metamagic feat and the Empower Spell metamagic feat
      (additively, increasing the damage by 100% instead of 50%). </p> <p></p>
