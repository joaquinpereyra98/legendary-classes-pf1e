    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you gain the bannerAPG and greater banner class
      features of a cavalier of your cleric level, and your banner is considered
      visible so long as your holy symbol is visible. You may select an
      alternate bannerCoL if you so wish. By spending a faith point, you may
      wave your standard as a move action rather than a standard action. </p>
