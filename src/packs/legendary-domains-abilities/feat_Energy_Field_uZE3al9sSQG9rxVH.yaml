  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 point of
      faith to convert some of the energy of that spell into a barrier for your
      allies. Reduce the damage of the spell by 20%, and grant allies within 30
      feet of you temporary hp equal to the reduction. </p>
