      <p> If you chose to channel negative energy at 1st level, you gain the
      ability to channel positive energy as well. If you chose to channel
      positive energy, you can channel energy as a move action instead of a
      standard. If you do not have the channel energy class feature, you gain
      it, but can only choose to channel positive energy. </p>
