    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, most animals are automatically friendly to you. Animals
      allied with or owned by your enemies and magical beasts are indifferent to
      you. In either case, they will not attack you or your allies without
      provocation, even if ordered to. As a standard action, you can make a
      Handle Animal check against any animal or magical beast to perform a task
      or trick, even if you arenâ€™t its trainer. </p>
