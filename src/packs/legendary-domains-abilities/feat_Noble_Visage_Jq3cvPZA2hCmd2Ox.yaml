  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level, you gain a natural aura of nobility that makes you seem
      more impressive to others. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Bluff and
      Intimidate skill checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every
      4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. As a standard
      action, you can spend 1 point of faith to touch an ally and grant them
      this bonus for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p>
