  description:
    value: >-
      <p> You can create an illusory double of yourself as a move action by
      spending a faith point. This double functions as a single mirror image and
      lasts for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level or until the
      illusory duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. An additional mirror image
      is created at 4th level and every 3 cleric levels thereafter. You can have
      no more than one copycat effect at a time. This ability does not stack
      with the mirror image spell. </p>
