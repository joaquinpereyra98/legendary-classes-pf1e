    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level, your knowledge of plants allows effective healing, even
      without magic. You can spend 1 point of faith and 1 minute to treat a
      willing creatureâ€™s wounds with medicinal herbs and berries, healing them
      for 2d8 points of damage. At 6th level, and every 2 levels thereafter,
      this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 10d8 at 20th level. </p>
