  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When you make a request of someone and roll Diplomacy, you can spend 1
      point of faith to infuse your voice with magic compelling them to do as
      you wish. Instead of using your Diplomacy result against the regular DC,
      they instead make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + ½ your cleric level
      + your Wisdom modifier + ¼ of the Diplomacy result. If they fail, they are
      compelled to perform the task, as suggestion. </p>
