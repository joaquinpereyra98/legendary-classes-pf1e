    value: >-
      <p>You can use the electric blast wild talent or the thunderstorm
      composite blast. Instead of accepting burn, you must spend 1 point of
      faith to use thunderstorm blast. When casting a spell with the electricity
      descriptor or your lightning or thunderstorm blast, you can spend 1 point
      of faith as a swift action to designate one creature within line of sight.
      The spell or blastâ€™s damage is increased by 50% against that target.</p>
