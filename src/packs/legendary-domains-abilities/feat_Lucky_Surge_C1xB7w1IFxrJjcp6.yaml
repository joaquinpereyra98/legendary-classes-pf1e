    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 16th level, you can spend 1 point of faith as an immediate
      action to double the bonuses granted by your aura of luck for one round.
      You can use this ability after an ally fails an attack roll or saving
      throw, potentially changing the results of that check. After this ability
      ends, your aura of luck ends, and you cannot use it again for one minute.
      This does not stack with other abilities which double luck bonuses. </p>
