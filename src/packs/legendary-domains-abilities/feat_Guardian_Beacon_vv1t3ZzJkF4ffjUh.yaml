    value: >-
      <p> As a swift action you can spend 1 point of faith to empower your
      guardianâ€™s aura, declaring your allies under your protection. For 1
      minute, enemies take a penalty to attack rolls against creatures within
      your aura equal to the resistance bonus granted by the aura. This benefit
      does not apply to you. </p>
