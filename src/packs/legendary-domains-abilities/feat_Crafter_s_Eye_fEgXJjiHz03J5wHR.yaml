      <p> A skilled eye for detail replaces any need for magic in identifying
      magic items. You can use Craft in place of Spellcraft to identify magic
      items. By spending 1 point of faith you can do so at a glance, taking a
      swift action rather than 3 rounds to identify a magic item. </p>
