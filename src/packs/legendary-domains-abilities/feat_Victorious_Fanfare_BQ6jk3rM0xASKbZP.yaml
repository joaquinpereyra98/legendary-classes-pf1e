    value: >-
      <p> Every fight you walk away from as the winner is a glorious one.
      Starting at 16th level, when combat ends you can spend 3 points of faith
      to immediately restore yourself and your allies within 60 feet to your
      maximum hit points. You cannot use this ability if you are unconscious or
      helpless. </p>
