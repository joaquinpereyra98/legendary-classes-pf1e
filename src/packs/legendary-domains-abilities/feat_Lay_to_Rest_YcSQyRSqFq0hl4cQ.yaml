    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, when you channel negative energy, you can spend 1 point
      of faith to heal living creatures and harm undead creatures instead of the
      normal effect. In addition, when you choose creatures to exclude you can
      instead harm them as though they were undead. </p>
