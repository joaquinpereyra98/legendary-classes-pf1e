    value: >-
      <p> When a creature fails a Reflex save against a spell you cast that
      deals fire damage, they catch on fire, taking damage equal to your kinetic
      blast each round. At the end of their turn they gain a new Reflex save
      against the spellâ€™s DC to put themselves out. </p>
