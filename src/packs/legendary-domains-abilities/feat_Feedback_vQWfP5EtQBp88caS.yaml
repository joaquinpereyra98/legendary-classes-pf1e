    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you can harness the excess energy from your healing and
      turn it volatile instead of protective. Whenever you cast a spell of the
      healing subdomain or channel to heal, you can spend 1 point of faith to
      convert all healing in excess of the targetsâ€™ maximum hp into damage.
      Enemies within 30 feet of you take this damage (maximum 5 points per
      cleric level, Will save for half ). </p>
