  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, when you cast a spell that affects a specific area, you
      can spend 1 point of faith and increase the casting time by 10 minutes to
      engrave a rune scheme into the environment, making the duration permanent.
      Spells cast in this way cannot be tied to a rune using your runestone
      ability. The spell can be disabled by a Disable Device or Spellcraft check
      with a DC equal to the spellâ€™s DC + 10. </p>
