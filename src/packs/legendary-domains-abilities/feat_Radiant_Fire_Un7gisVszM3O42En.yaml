    value: >-
      <p> When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can expend spend 1
      point of faith to soothe your allies, rather than harm them. A number of
      creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier are not damaged by the spell,
      healed for an amount equal to half the spellâ€™s fire damage, and are
      affected by any mercies you have selected. </p>
