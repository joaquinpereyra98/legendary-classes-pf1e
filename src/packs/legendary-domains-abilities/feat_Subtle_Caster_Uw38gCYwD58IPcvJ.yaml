    value: >-
      <p> At 8th level, you gain Conceal Spell and Improved Conceal Spell as
      bonus feats even if you do not meet the prerequisites. You may use your
      cleric level in place of your ranks in Bluff, Disguise, or Sleight of Hand
      and your Wisdom modifier in place of your Charisma or Dexterity modifier
      to set the DC of the Conceal Spell feat, and may spend a faith point as
      part of using Conceal Spell to increase the DC by 5 for that particular
      casting. </p>
