  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Whenever you cast a plant domain spell or use wood blast, you may
      spend a faith point to cause any affected creatures to become entangled
      for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. Any creature who
      succeeds at their saving throw against the effect negates the entangled
      condition, while creatures hit by your wood blast are allowed a Reflex
      saving throw to negate this entanglement. </p>
