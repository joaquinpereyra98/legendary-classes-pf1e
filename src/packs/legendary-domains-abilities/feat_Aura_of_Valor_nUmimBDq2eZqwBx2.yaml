  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 8th level, you gain an aura that inspires others. Allies within 30
      feet of you gain a +2 morale bonus on saves against fear and compulsion
      effects. You can spend 1 point of faith as a standard action to grant
      immunity to those effects for 1 minute but allies already under such an
      effect do not gain this immunity. </p> <p></p>
