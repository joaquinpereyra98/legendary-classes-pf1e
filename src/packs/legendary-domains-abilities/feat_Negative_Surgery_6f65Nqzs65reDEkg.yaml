  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 8th level your healing spells draw on negative as well as positive
      energy, targeting unwelcome pathogens, jolting the targetâ€™s nervous system
      or even directly affecting magic. When casting a spell with the (healing)
      subtype, you can spend 1 point of faith to additionally attempt to remove
      a disease, poison, or negative status effect on the target. Make a caster
      level check against the save DC of the effect. If you are successful, the
      effect is removed from the target. If your spell targets multiple
      creatures, roll once against the same effect on each of them. </p> <p></p>
