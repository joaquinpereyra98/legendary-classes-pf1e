    value: >-
      <p> You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have
      darkvision, you instead increase its range by 60 feet. Darkvision gained
      from this ability does not work in magical darkness except from your cloak
      of shadows ability. As a swift action, you can spend a point of faith to
      grant this ability to your allies within 30 feet for one minute. </p>
