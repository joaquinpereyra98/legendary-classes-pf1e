  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you become so adept at controlling enemy magic, you can
      turn it back on them. When you successfully counterspell, you may spend 1
      additional point of faith to instead redirect the spell. If the spell
      targets specific creatures, it only affects the original caster, and if it
      affects an area it is centered on the casterâ€™s square. </p> <p></p>
