    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 16th level, if a creature that was life linked to you
      dies, you can spend 3 points of faith as an immediate action to tether
      their soul to their body. They fall unconscious but remain alive for three
      rounds. If their hit point total is increased to a negative amount less
      than their Constitution score or higher and any other negative effects
      responsible for their death are removed, they do not die. If they were
      killed by a death effect that instantly killed them, that effect can be
      removed with dispel magic or similar effects. </p>
