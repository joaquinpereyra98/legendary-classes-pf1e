      <p> At 8th level, you can give your allies a portion of your own life
      force. As an immediate action, you can spend 1 point of faith and reduce
      your hit points by any amount. You can then distribute an equal number of
      hit points among allies you are life linked to, healing them for the
      amount distributed to them. </p> <p></p>
