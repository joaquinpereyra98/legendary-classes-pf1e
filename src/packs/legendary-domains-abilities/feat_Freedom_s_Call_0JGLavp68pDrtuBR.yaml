  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of freedom for 1 minute by
      spending a faith point. Allies within this aura are not affected by the
      confused, grappled, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, pinned, or shaken
      conditions. This aura only suppresses these effects, and they return once
      a creature leaves the aura or when the aura ends, if applicable. </p>
