    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level, choose a paladin mercy as though you were a paladin of
      your cleric level. When you channel energy or cast a spell with the
      healing subdomain, you can spend 1 point of faith to apply one mercy to
      the effect. You can choose one additional mercy every 3 levels after you
      gain this ability. </p>
