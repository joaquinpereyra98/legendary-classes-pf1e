    value: >-
      <p> Whenever you create or manipulate water, you may spend a faith point
      to have any creatures in the area of the water take 1d6 points of
      bludgeoning or cold damage (your choice) per 2 cleric levels. A successful
      fortitude save halves this damage. You are immune to damage from your own
      uses of this ability. </p>
