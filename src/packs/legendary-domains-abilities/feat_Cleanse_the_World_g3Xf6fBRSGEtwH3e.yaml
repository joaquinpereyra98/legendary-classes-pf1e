  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level your fire transcends physical limitation and becomes
      divine in nature. Any [fire] spell or blast you cast also gains the
      descriptors for your alignment. Dragons, undead, and outsiders with an
      opposite alignment component to yours take maximum damage from these
      spells and blasts (as per Maximize Spell) and do not gain the benefits of
      fire resistance or immunity against the damage. </p>
