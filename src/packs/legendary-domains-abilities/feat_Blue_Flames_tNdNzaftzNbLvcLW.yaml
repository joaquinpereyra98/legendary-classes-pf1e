  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 8th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals fire
      damage or use your fire blast, you can spend 1 point of faith as a swift
      action to treat the fire resistance of any affected creature as 10 lower.
      If an affected creature is immune to fire, they are instead treated as
      though they had fire resistance 30. </p> <p></p>
