    value: >-
      <p> You can spend 1 point of faith when casting a spell that creates
      darkness. If you do, it gains the [fear] descriptor. While in an area of
      magical darkness created by a spell cast this way, all creatures without
      darkvision must make a Will save against the DC of the spell or become
      shaken for as long as they are in the darkness. If they were already
      shaken or would become shaken from any other source while suffering this
      effect, they become frightened instead. In addition, you treat the level
      of any darkness spell as one spell level higher when determining its
      interaction with spells that create light. </p>
