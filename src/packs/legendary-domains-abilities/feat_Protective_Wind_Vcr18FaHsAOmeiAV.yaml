  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, you become surrounded by swirling winds that batter away
      blows. All ranged attacks made with physical weapons suffer a 20% miss
      chance against you, except for attacks from massive weapons such as a
      giantâ€™s thrown boulder or a ballista. This ability has no effect on ray
      attacks. You may activate this ability for 1 minute as a free action by
      spending a faith point and may spend a faith point whenever the duration
      would expire to continue the effect for an additional minute.</p>
