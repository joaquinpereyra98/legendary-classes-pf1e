    value: >-
      <p> The damage dice of your explosive strike increase to d10s. When you
      use your explosive strike, all creatures damaged by it must make a
      Fortitude save or gain a negative level. Regardless of their saving throw,
      the target of your attack takes an additional negative level on top of
      this. This is a death effect. </p>
