  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you gain an aura that soothes allies and prevents
      bloodshed. Allies within 30 feet of you roll twice and take the higher
      result on saving throws against emotion effects. Enemies within 30 feet
      must make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + Â½ your cleric level + your
      Wisdom modifier or be affected by calm emotions. This effect lasts until
      another creature takes a hostile action at them. Regardless of whether
      they save, they cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.
