    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, as a standard action you can spend 3 points of faith to
      create a massive, powerful explosion that tears through everything in its
      path. This deals force damage equal to 20d12 + your cleric level + double
      your Wisdom modifier to every creature and object within a 60 foot radius,
      including yourself. Creatures more than 30 feet away can attempt a Reflex
      save for half damage. </p> <p></p>
