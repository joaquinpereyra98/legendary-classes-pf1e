    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, whenever you use searing glory, you may spend an
      additional faith point to irradiate any creatures you choose within the
      area of effect. Irradiated creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or
      become exposed to Severe Radiation. This effect uses the DC of your domain
      abilities, not the normal DC of severe radiation. </p>
