  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When you channel or cast a spell with the healing subdomain, you can
      spend 2 points of faith to apply all 3rd and 6th level paladin mercies to
      the targets of the effect, instead of just one. For each 3rd and 6th level
      mercy you chose with merciful healer, you can choose a new mercy that you
      meet the prerequisites for, and are treated as having all 3rd and 6th
      level mercies for prerequisites. </p>
