  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level, light seems to fade around you, leaving you surrounded
      by shadow. The light level within 10 feet of you is reduced by one step.
      You can suppress or resume this aura as a standard action. You cannot use
      concealment granted by this ability to enter stealth, as the aura reveals
      your location. </p>
