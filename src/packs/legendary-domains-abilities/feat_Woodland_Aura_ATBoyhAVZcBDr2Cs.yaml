  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 8th level, you and allies within 30 feet of you can move
      through any sort of natural undergrowth (such as thorns, briars, overgrown
      areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage
      or suffering any other impairment. At a swift action, you can spend 1
      point of faith to make this aura effect magically created or manipulated
      undergrowth as well. </p>
