  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, the plants you conjure become thorny or brambly. When
      you cast a plant domain spell, you can spend 1 point of faith to grow
      these thorns and brambles to deadly size and sharpness. Creatures that
      begin their turn in the radius of these spells take 1d6 points of damage
      per spell level. A creature affected by your woodland aura does not take
      this damage. </p>
