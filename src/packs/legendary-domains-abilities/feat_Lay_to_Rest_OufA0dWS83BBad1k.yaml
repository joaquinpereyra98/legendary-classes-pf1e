      <p> Undead do not gain channel resistance against your channels. If you
      channel positive energy, you can spend 1 point of faith when you channel
      to harm to increase the damage by your cleric level. If you channel
      negative energy, you can spend 1 point of faith when you channel to harm
      to damage undead and not affect living creatures. </p>
