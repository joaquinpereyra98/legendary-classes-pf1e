  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, the enhancement bonus from sharpen increases to +3. In
      addition, when you use sharpen on a weapon or suit of armor, you can
      reallocate its existing enhancement bonus and special abilities so long as
      the item’s total effective enhancement bonus is not changed. For instance,
      the cleric could change the bane ability on a +4 evil outsider bane
      longsword to ghost touch but could not change the weapon to a +4 flaming
      burst longsword. This effect lasts for the duration of sharpen, although
      you may spend 1 hour outside of combat to permanently reallocate an item’s
      enhancement bonus and special abilities. </p>
