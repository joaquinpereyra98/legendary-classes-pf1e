      <p> At 8th level as a swift action, you can spend 1 point of faith to turn
      a 10 foot square of dirt or stone within 50 feet of you into difficult
      terrain. You can instead use this ability to turn a 10 foot square of
      difficult terrain into normal terrain if it is made of dirt or stone. </p>
