    value: >-
      <p> At 8th level, allies affected by your victorious strike ability also
      gain a +2 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls for one round. If they
      are already benefitting from a morale bonus to one of these rolls, that
      bonus is instead increased by +1 for the same duration. </p> <p></p>
