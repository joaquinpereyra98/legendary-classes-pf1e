    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 16th level, your fascinating gaze lasts a number of rounds
      equal to your Wisdom modifier. In addition, you can damage the target of
      your fascinating gaze without breaking their fascination; damage from
      other creatures still ends the fascination. </p>
