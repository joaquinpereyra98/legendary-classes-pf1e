    value: >-
      <p>You can spend 1 point of faith as a swift action to extend your wind
      out over a wide distance for one minute. Allies within 30 feet of you gain
      the benefits of your protective wind ability. If there are no allies
      within 30 feet, or if you choose not to share the ability, the increased
      wind concentrates on you, intensifying and making you immune to ranged
      attacks made with physical weapons, including massive weapons</p>
