      <p> When you first gain this domain, choose from a 1d6 bite, a 1d6 gore,
      or two 1d4 claws. As a swift action, you can spend 1 point of faith to
      gain the natural attack(s) you chose for one minute per cleric level. You
      can only gain them while in your natural form. In addition, you are
      permanently under the effects of speak with animals. </p>
