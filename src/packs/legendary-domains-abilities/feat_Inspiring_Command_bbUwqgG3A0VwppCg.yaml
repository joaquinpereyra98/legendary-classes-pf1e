    value: >-
      <p> As a standard action, you can spend 1 point of faith to issue an
      inspiring command to your allies within 30 feet. Affected allies gain a +2
      sacred bonus on attack rolls, AC, combat maneuver defense, saving throws
      and skill checks for 1 round. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting
      effect. </p>
