      <p> At 16th level, you may spend 3 faith points when using your explosive
      strike to forgo the damage from the ability, turning the explosive energy
      into pure negative energy. All creatures in the burst except for you must
      make a Fortitude save or instantly die. This is a death effect. </p>
