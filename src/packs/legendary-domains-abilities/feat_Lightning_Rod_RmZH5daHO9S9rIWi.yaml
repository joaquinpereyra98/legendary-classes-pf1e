  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, lightning is drawn to you like a moth to the flame. You
      become immune to electricity. As an immediate action while within 30 feet
      of the target or center of a spell or ability that does electricity
      damage, you can spend 1 point of faith to redirect all of the electricity
      damage to yourself. This does not affect any other damage from the spell
      or ability.</p>
