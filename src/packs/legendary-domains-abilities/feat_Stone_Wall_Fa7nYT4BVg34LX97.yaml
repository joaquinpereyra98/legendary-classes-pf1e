    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level you can raise stone from the ground to create cover for
      yourself and your allies. You can spend 1 point of faith to create stone
      walls, as the kinetic coverOA wild talent. At 10th level, when you use
      this ability you can raise two faces of any squares in range so long as
      those faces touch. At 14th level this increases to three faces, and at
      18th level it increases to four. </p>
