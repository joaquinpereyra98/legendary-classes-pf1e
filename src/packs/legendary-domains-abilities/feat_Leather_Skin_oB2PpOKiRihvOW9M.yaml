  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Your skin doesnâ€™t bear the scales of your venerated creatures but is
      naturally tougher than most. You gain a +1 natural armor bonus to your
      armor class. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every 4 levels
      thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. As an immediate action you
      can spend 1 point of faith to double this bonus for 1 round, your skin
      turning to a facsimile of real scales. If the bonus is already doubled,
      you may spend a faith point as a free action to extend the duration for an
      additional round. </p>
