    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you can use the lingering life force of the recently
      deceased to power your magic. While within 5 feet the body of a creature
      that has died within the last round, you can spend two points of faith to
      cast a single death domain spell with a spell level no greater than one
      quarter the creatureâ€™s Hit Dice (rounded down) without expending a spell
      slot. </p> <p></p>
