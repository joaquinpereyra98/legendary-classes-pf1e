      <p> All people are connected through the soil beneath their feet, and you
      can see those connections with ease. At 16th level, while standing on
      earth you can spend 5 points of faith to locate any creature you
      personally know anywhere in the world, as locate creature. This has no
      effect if the target is airborne. </p> <p></p>
