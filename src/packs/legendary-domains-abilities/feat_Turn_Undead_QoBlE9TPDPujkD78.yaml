  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level you gain Turn Undead as a bonus feat, using your Wisdom
      modifier in place of your Charisma modifier. You can spend uses of channel
      negative energy or 1 point of faith to use this ability. Volatile Channel
      (Su): At 8th level, you can spend 1 point of faith when you channel to
      harm undead or cast a spell that affects undead. If they fail their save
      against the channel or spell, they are staggered for 1 round. If the spell
      does not give them a save, they can make a Will save against this effect.
