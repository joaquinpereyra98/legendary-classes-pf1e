  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When you cast a harmless spell or channel energy that heals one or
      more creatures, you can spend 1 point of faith to infuse the effect with
      good luck. Anyone affected by the spell or channel can reroll a single d20
      before the results of the roll are revealed any time within the next
      minute. They must take the result of the reroll, even if itâ€™s worse than
      the original. </p>
