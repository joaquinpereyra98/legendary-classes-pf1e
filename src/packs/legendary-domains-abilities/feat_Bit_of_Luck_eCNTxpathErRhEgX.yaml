    value: >-
      <p> As an immediate action before an ally within 30 feet makes an attack
      roll, skill check or saving throw, you can spend 1 point of faith to
      bestow a bit of luck on them. Until the start of their next turn, they
      roll twice and take the better result on all d20 rolls. </p>
