      <p> At 16th level, you shed the last anchors you have to humanity,
      becoming truly one with the beast inside. You can use wild shape at will,
      and the duration becomes permanent. In addition, while in a wild shape
      form you can change to any form your wild shape would allow as a swift
      action. You can dismiss your wild shape at any time as an immediate
      action. </p>
