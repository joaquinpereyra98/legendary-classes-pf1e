    value: >-
      <p> You become permanently under the effects of death ward. As a standard
      action, you can spend 1 point of faith to extend this effect into an aura
      affecting allies within 30 feet for a number of minutes equal to your
      Wisdom modifier. A creature who dies under this effect does not rise as an
      undead, even if an effect such as ghoul fever or create spawn would cause
      them to. </p>
