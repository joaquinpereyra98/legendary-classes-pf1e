  description:
    value: >-
      <p> You dedicate yourself to the power of dragons and are rewarded with
      greater resilience. Choose one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types.
      When you spend faith to double your natural armor bonus, your skin turns
      the color of the dragon you chose, and you gain immunity to its associated
      energy type for the duration of the effect (acid for black, green and
      copper, cold for white and silver, electricity for blue and bronze, and
      fire for red, brass and gold) and the duration of the benefit extends to 1
      minute. In this state, you also grow wings and gain a fly speed with good
      maneuverability equal to twice your land speed. </p>
