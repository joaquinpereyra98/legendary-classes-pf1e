    value: >-
      <p> You can layer your words with magic. Your spells with the charm
      subschool are cast as if they were modified by the Still Spell feat. This
      does not increase their level or casting time. When you cast such a spell,
      you can increase the casting time to 1 round and spend 1 point of faith.
      If you do so, your spellcasting is undetectable by Spellcraft checks,
      though others can notice your target acting strangely and roll Sense
      Motive as normal. </p>
