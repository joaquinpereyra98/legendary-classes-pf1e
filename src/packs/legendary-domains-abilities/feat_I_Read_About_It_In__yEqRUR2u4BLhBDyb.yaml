      <p> Starting at 16th level, the breadth of your research and information
      becomes staggering. When presented with a Knowledge check, you can spend 1
      minute going through your own notes, rereading the books you carry with
      you, or searching through your memory to take 20 on the check without
      expending a use of your lore master ability. </p> <p></p>
