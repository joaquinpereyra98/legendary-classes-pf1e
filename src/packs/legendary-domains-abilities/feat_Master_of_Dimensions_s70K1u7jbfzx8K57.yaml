    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you do not expend distance for using dimensional hop to
      teleport less than 60 feet. In addition, you may spend 20 feet of movement
      from dimensional hop to transport a willing creature between planes (as
      per plane shift) instead of teleporting it. </p> <p></p>
