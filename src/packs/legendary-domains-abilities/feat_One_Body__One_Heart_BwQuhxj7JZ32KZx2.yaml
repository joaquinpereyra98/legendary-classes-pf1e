    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you can connect the life forces of yourself and your
      allies to share all of your burdens. As a swift action you can spend 3
      points of faith. For one minute, whenever you or a creature you are life
      linked to would take damage, that damage is evenly distributed to that
      creature, yourself, and all other creatures you are life linked to. A
      creature under your life link can dismiss the effect as a free action
      before damage is calculated. </p> <p></p>
