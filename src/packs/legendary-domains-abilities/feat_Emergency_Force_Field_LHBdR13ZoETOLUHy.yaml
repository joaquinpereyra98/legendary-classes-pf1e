  description:
    value: >-
      <p> When you use your emergency barrier ability, you can spend 1
      additional point of faith to instead create a solid shield of energy
      between your target and their attacker. This functions as wall of force,
      but only affects one edge of a single 5-foot square and lasts until the
      start of the targetâ€™s next turn. </p>
