    value: >-
      <p> Your natural attacks from call of the wild are infused with the power
      of your faith. If you chose a bite, you gain your choice of the trip or
      grab ability on your bite. If you chose a gore, you gain the powerful
      charge ability, dealing 2d8 + double your Strength modifier. If you chose
      claws, your claws gain an 18-20 critical range. These effects apply while
      in wild shape as well, but only to the selected natural attack. </p>
