    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, your abilities with metamagic become second to none.
      Whenever you cast a spell, you can increase the casting time by 1 step to
      apply any metamagics you know as though you were a spontaneous caster.
      When you do so you can spend faith to reduce the spell level adjustment
      with your augment spells ability. </p>
