  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 16th level you can spend 3 points of faith as a standard
      action to select one negative effect that an ally within 30 feet is
      suffering from. This effect can include any negative condition, poison,
      disease or spell except for death. All willing allies within 30 feet have
      this effect removed. If it is a magical effect with a caster level greater
      than your cleric level, the effect is instead suppressed for a number of
      rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p>
