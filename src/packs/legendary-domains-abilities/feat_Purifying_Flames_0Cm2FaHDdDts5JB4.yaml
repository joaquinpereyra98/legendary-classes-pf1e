    value: >-
      <p> At 4th level you can select a mercy as a paladin of your level. You
      can spend 1 point of faith to touch a willing creature as a standard
      action, healing them for an amount equal to your kinetic blast damage and
      applying any mercies youâ€™ve chosen. Every 3 levels after you gain this
      ability, you can select another mercy. </p>
