    value: >-
      <p> As a standard action, you can spend 1 point of faith to draw on the
      power of death and decay to remind others of their mortality. You deal
      negative energy damage to a target within 30 feet equal to 1d6 + your
      Wisdom modifier and make them shaken for one round. A Fortitude save
      halves this damage and negates the shaken condition. At 4th level, and
      every 3 levels thereafter this damage increases by 1d6. This effect
      damages undead and creatures with negative energy affinity rather than
      healing them. </p>
