  description:
    value: >-
      <p> At 8th level, you can lace spells you cast or kinetic blasts you use
      with the sublime by spending a faith point. If the target is struck by the
      effect or fails their saving throw against the effect, they must succeed
      at a Will save or become confused for a number of rounds equal to half
      your cleric level. The victim must succeed at a new saving throw each
      round to end the effectâ€”these additional saving throws apply only to the
      additional confusion effect and not to the original spell effect. Part the
      veil is a mind-affecting effect. You may only affect one target with this
      ability per use. </p>
