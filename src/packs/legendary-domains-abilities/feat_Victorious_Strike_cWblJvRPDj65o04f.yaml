  description:
    value: >-
      <p> As an immediate action when you reduce a creature below 0 hit points,
      you can spend 1 point of faith to release a burst of celebratory healing.
      All allies within 30 feet are healed as though you had just channeled to
      heal, even if they would normally be unaffected (for instance, if they
      were living creatures and you channel negative energy). This ability has
      no effect if the triggering creature was helpless, unaware, or had fewer
      Hit Dice than half your character level. </p>
