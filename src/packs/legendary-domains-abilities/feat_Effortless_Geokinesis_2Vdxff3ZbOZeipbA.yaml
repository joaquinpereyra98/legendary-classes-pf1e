      <p> You can use your basic geokinesis and stone wall abilities as a swift
      action. In addition, as a swift action you can spend 1 point of faith to
      dig deep pits. This functions as create pit, but deals no damage to
      creatures in the area of the pit when you use this ability. </p>
