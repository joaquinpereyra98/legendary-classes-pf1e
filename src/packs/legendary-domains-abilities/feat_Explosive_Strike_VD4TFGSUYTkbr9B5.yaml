  description:
    value: >-
      <p> Starting at 4th level when you successfully make a melee attack, you
      can spend 1 point of faith as a swift action to create an explosion. This
      deals force damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier to all creatures
      (including yourself ) in a 10-foot radius. This damage increases by 1d8 at
      4th level and every 3 levels thereafter. </p>
