    value: >-
      <p> At 16th level, you may spend a faith point as part of casting a
      (glamer) or (figment) spell to make any change quasi-real, like those
      created by shadow conjuration. A creature that interacts with reshaped
      reality may make a Will save to see through the semi-real illusion.
      Terrain can provide concealment, and against foes who do not make the Will
      save to see through the facade, reshaped reality can provide cover. For
      disbelievers, quasi-real objects and terrain have only 20% normal hardness
      and hit points, and break DCs are 10 lower than normal. Dangerous terrain
      cannot exceed 5d6 points of damage per round (1d6 per round against
      disbelievers). This ability cannot damage existing structures. </p>
