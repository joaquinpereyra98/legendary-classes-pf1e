    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Alchemist 6th.</p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i>
      1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen with
      this discovery applied, they gain a circumstance bonus to Stealth checks
      equal to their class level, masking both their visual and auditory
      presence. In addition, blindsense, blindsight, and tremorsense do not
      automatically detect them, requiring a Perception check to discern their
      location. The alchemist can spend an additional 2 quintessence to become
      invisible for the duration of their mutagen, although attacking a creature
      or any effect which would end the effect of the <i>invisibility</i> spell
      ends their invisibility, but not the duration of their mutagen. </p> <p>
      <i>Special:</i> If an alchemist possesses this discovery, whenever they
      imbibe any mutagen, they gain a circumstance bonus to Stealth checks equal
      to 1/2 their class level. In addition, blindsense and tremorsense do not
      automatically detect them, requiring a Perception check to discern their
      location. </p>
