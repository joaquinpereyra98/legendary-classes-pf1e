    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist
      creates a bomb, they can choose to have it suppress light sources on the
      target. This extinguishes non-magical light sources carried by the target
      and dispels magical light sources for a number of rounds equal to the
      alchemist's Intelligence modifier as <i>deeper darkness</i>. </p>
