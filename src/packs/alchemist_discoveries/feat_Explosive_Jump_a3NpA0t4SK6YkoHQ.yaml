    value: >-
      <p>Benefit: As a swift action, an alchemist can use excess chemicals from
      their bombs to lift themselves up to 10 feet vertically, dealing splash
      damage to all adjacent spaces to themselves. They can combine this with a
      move action if they wish, and the character can end their movement in the
      air. If they do, at the beginning of their next round, they must decide if
      they will use an additional swift action to maintain their current
      altitude or drop to the ground (the alchemist does not take falling damage
      when using this ability). This ability cannot raise the alchemist's
      altitude higher than the amount of height they would gain with this
      ability. At 5th level and every five levels afterwards, they increase the
      amount of height they gain from this ability by 10 feet.</p>

      <p>Special: The alchemist can select this discovery a second time; if they
      do, they can use this ability once per round as a free action and this
      movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>Special: If the alchemist has the precise explosion discovery, they can
      choose to use it with this discovery, selecting a number of spaces equal
      to their Intelligence modifier to avoid damaging.</p>

      <p>Special: An alchemist with the aquatic engineer discovery can use this
      discovery underwater, tripling the distance they can travel and allowing
      them to use it in any direction.</p>
