    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus to saving
      throws against mind-affecting effects. This increases by +2 at 5th level
      and every 4 levels thereafter. If they fail a saving throw against a
      mind-affecting effect, they may reroll their saving throw as an immediate
      action, but are confused until the end of their next turn. </p>
