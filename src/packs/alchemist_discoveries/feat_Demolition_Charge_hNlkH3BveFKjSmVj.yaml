      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can choose to
      have it deal damage to an object as if by a sunder combat maneuver,
      ignoring an amount of hardness equal to their alchemist level. If the item
      is worn or held by an opponent, the item is considered the direct target,
      and the wearer/holder takes splash damage from the blast. If the object is
      unattended, a demolition charge instead bypasses the object's hardness on
      a direct hit; this bonus doesn't affect the bomb's splash damage. If the
      bomb reduces an inanimate target to half its hit points or fewer, it blows
      a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the target. </p>
