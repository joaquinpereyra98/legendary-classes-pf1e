      1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can
      choose to have it deal aligned divine damage, choosing an alignment upon
      creation (this alignment cannot be one that opposes their own). Creatures
      with an alignment that directly opposes the bomb's alignment (good/evil or
      law/chaos) that take a direct hit from an aligned bomb must succeed at a
      Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against creatures who
      are neutral to the bomb's aligned axis, aligned bombs deal half damage,
      and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Aligned
      bombs have no effect on creatures that share the bomb's alignment. </p>
