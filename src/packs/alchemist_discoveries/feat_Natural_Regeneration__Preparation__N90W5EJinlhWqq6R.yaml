      <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i> 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> As a free action
      once per round, the alchemist can heal 5 hit points as if they had the
      fast healing ability. They can heal 5 hit points per day in this manner
      for each alchemist level they possess. If the alchemist falls unconscious
      because of hit point damage and still has healing available from this
      ability, the ability activates automatically each round until they are
      conscious again or the ability is depleted for the day. While the
      alchemist has any hit points recoverable to them from this ability, they
      cannot die from hit point loss. At 8th level, whenever the alchemist heals
      from this ability, they are also treated as though under the effects of a
      <i>regenerate</i> spell, targeting any missing body parts or such that
      they have. </p>
