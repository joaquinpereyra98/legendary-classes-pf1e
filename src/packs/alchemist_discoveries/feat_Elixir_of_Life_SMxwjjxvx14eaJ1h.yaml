      <p>Prerequisite(s): Alchemist 14th.</p>

      <p>Benefit: The alchemist can brew an elixir of life; This special
      concoction costs 20,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir
      of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life
      to a dead creature as per the spell true resurrection. Alternatively, the
      alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point they are
      immediately targeted with a true resurrection spell the next time they are
      killed. Used in this manner, the elixir lasts indefinitely, although an
      alchemist cannot benefit from more than one elixir of life at the same
      time.</p>
