      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist learns how to create a philosopher's
      stone, and can do so once per month at no cost. Creating a philosopher's
      stone takes 1 day of work. Creating this stone cures the alchemist of
      aging, and from this point forward they take no penalty to no physical
      ability scores from advanced age. If the alchemist is already taking such
      penalties, they are removed at this time, and the alchemist can revert
      themselves back to their appearance as a young adult. In addition, the
      alchemist is immune to death effects, diseases, poisons, and no longer
      requiring food, water, or air. </p>
