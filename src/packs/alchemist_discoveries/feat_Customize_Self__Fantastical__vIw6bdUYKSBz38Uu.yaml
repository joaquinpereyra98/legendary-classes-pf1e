    value: >-
      <p> <i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Automaton with fantastical customizations,
      customize self (major). </p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Choose a fantastical
      customization. The alchemist gains its benefit, but not any increase to
      armor bonus or ability scores it would grant an automaton. </p> <p>
      <b>Special</b>: If the customization you choose refers to or modifies the
      automaton's slam attack and you do not have one, you may instead treat
      your unarmed strike as if it were a slam for the purposes of that
      customization. This does not give you the ability to make unarmed strikes
      as if armed. You may select this discovery more than once, choosing a
      different fantastical customization each time. </p>
