      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist can cause their bombs to splash in a
      15-foot cone instead of a 5-foot-radius burst or that splash in a 40-foot
      line rather than affecting a radius. If the alchemist chooses to have
      their bombs explode in a cone, they choose the direction of the cone. If
      the attack misses, roll an additional 1d8 to determine the direction of
      the blast from where the bomb lands. If the alchemist has the explosive
      bomb discovery, it instead becomes a 20-foot cone. </p> <p> If the
      alchemist chooses to have their bombs explode in a line, the line starts
      at the alchemist and extends away from him in the direction they choose.
      The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the line
      to be the target of the bomb and makes their attack roll against that
      creature; all other squares in the line take splash damage. If the
      alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery, the line of splash damage is
      80 feet long instead of 40 feet. </p>
