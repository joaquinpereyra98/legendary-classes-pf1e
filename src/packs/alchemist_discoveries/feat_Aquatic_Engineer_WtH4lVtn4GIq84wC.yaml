      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist gains the ability to throw bombs
      underwater (normally, thrown weapons cannot be used underwater), including
      throwing from the air into the water; bombs which would normally deal fire
      damage can function underwater, creating steam instead of fire. If the
      bomb travels through water, the range increment is unaffected. In
      addition, when the alchemist creates a bomb, they can choose to either
      weight it or includes excess air as part of the action of creating the
      bomb, granting the bomb their choice of swiftly rising or swiftly sinking
      buoyancy which causes the bomb to travel 100 feet per round in the
      direction of their choice and allowing them to target creatures directly
      above or below them. If the attack misses, the bomb doesn't deal splash
      damage, but instead continues to travel up or down until it loses potency
      at the end of the alchemist's turn or collides against a solid object,
      detonating as normal. During any round in which the alchemist creates a
      bomb, they are treated as though they could breathe normally. </p>
