      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist chooses an element (air, earth, fire, or
      water) whenever they create a mutagen. Whenever the alchemist imbibes a
      mutagen with this discovery applied, they gain resistance 5 to the
      associated energy type and a +2 competence bonus on an associated skill
      check. For every four class levels the alchemist possesses, this
      resistance is increased by 5 and the competence bonus is increased by 3;
      the alchemist also gains the skill unlock for the associated skill. The
      elements and their associated energies and skills are air (electricity,
      Fly), earth (acid, Climb), fire (fire, Acrobatics), and water (cold,
      Swim). </p>
