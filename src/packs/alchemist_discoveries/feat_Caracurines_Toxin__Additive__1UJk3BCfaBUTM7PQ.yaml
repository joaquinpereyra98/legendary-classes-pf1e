    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When an alchemist
      applies this discovery to a toxin, a creature who fails their saving throw
      has either 1 arm, 1 leg, or 1 wing paralyzed instead of becoming sickened.
      </p> <p> A creature with a paralyzed arm cannot use that arm to wield a
      weapon, hold a shield, hold any items, manipulate items, or use natural
      attacks associated with that limb (such as claws or slam attacks) </p> <p>
      A creature with a paralyzed leg has their base land speed reduced to 5
      feet (unless it would normally be lower), cannot run, takes a -5 penalty
      to all athletics checks, and cannot use natural attacks associated with
      that limb (such as claw or talon attacks) </p> <p> A creature with a
      paralyzed wing cannot use that wing to fly or make natural attacks
      associated with that limb (such as wing buffets) </p>
