      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Ooze mutagen, alchemist 8th.</p> <p>
      <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the alchemist takes slashing or piercing damage
      while under the effect of the ooze mutagen discovery, they can choose to
      split themselves into two different halves; these two halves are perfect
      copies of the alchemist, splitting the alchemist's remaining hit points
      between the two. The copies use the same statistics, share the same
      resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one
      copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use
      from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended
      from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate
      item disappears from the other copy as well. The two copies act
      independently, although they can only use a full round action worth of
      actions between them (one move action, one standard action, one swift
      action or any combination of the listed actions). </p> <p> At the end of
      the alchemist's next turn, they select one of the copies, which is treated
      as the alchemist's true body; the other copy dissolves into a puddle of
      sludge and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this
      happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and the
      alchemist gains 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed
      simultaneously (such as from a <i>fireball</i>), both copies collapse into
      formless goo and the alchemist can only be restored to life via
      <i>resurrection</i> or similarly powerful magic. </p>
