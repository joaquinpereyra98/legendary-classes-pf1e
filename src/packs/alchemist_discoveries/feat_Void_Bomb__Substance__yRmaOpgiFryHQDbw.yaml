      1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can
      choose to have it create a powerful gravitic force. Void bombs deals
      bludgeoning damage, and a creature hit by the bomb must succeed at a
      Reflex save against the bomb's DC. If it fails, it is knocked prone and
      all of its movement speeds are reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. If it
      succeeds, all of its movement speeds are reduced to 5 feet for 1 round.
      Other creatures within 5 feet of the bomb's target take no damage but must
      succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC or have all their movement
      speeds reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. </p>
