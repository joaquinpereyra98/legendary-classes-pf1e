      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this
      discovery applied, they gain either a gore or bite attack (chosen when
      they apply this discovery to the mutagen). This is a primary natural
      attack that deals 1d8 damage (piercing for gore attacks and piercing,
      bludgeoning, and slashing for bite attacks). </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If
      an alchemist possesses this discovery, whenever they imbibe any mutagen,
      they gain the scent special quality, allowing them to detect opponents
      within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range
      increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can
      be detected at twice the normal range. Scent does not allow the alchemist
      to precisely locate the creature, only to detect its presence. It can
      detect the direction with a move action. The alchemist can pinpoint the
      creature's location if it is within 5 feet and can use scent to track
      creatures. </p>
