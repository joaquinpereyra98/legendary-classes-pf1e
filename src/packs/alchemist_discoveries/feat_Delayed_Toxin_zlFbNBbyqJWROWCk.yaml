    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist can
      choose to have their toxin not take immediate effect and are always aware
      if a creature has made a successful saving throw against their toxin. When
      a creature has failed a saving throw against the alchemist's toxin, they
      can choose for it to lay dormant in their system for a number of hours
      equal to their Intelligence modifier. At 10th level, the alchemist can
      instead choose for it to lay dormant for a number of days equal to their
      Intelligence modifier and can select a specific triggering action which
      will activate it (such as speaking to a specific individual, bringing up a
      specific topic, or casting a specific spell). </p>
