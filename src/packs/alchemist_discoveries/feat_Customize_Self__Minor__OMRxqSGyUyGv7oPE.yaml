    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Choose a minor customization. The alchemist gains its
      benefit, but not any increase to armor bonus or ability scores it would
      grant an automaton. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If the customization you
      choose refers to or modifies the automaton's slam attack and you do not
      have one, you may instead treat your unarmed strike as if it were a slam
      for the purposes of that customization. This does not give you the ability
      to make unarmed strikes as if armed. You may select this discovery more
      than once, choosing a different minor customization each time. </p>
