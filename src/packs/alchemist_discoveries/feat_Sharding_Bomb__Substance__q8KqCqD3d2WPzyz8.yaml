  description:
    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist's bomb deals piercing damage instead of
      fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a sharding bomb
      must succeed at a Reflex save or take bleed damage equal to the bomb's
      minimum damage in addition to normal damage. In addition, they can choose
      to have it cover the ground in volatile jagged crystals in addition to its
      normal effects. These crystals act like caltrops, evaporating into a
      harmless gas in 1 minute. </p>
