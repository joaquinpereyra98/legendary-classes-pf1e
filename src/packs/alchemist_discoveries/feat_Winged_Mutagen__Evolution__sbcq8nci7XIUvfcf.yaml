    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 6th.</p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>:
      2</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen with
      this discovery applied, they grow a set of wings which grants them a 60
      foot flight speed with good maneuverability. The alchemist can spend an
      additional 1 quintessence when applying this discovery to a mutagen to
      grant them two wing buffet attacks. These attacks are secondary attacks
      and deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). </p> <p>
      <b>Special</b>: If an alchemist possesses this discovery, whenever they
      imbibe any mutagen, they can choose to grow a pair of vestigial wings,
      granting them the ability to <i>glide</i> as per the spell. </p>
