    value: >-
      <p>Benefit: The alchemist creates a Diminutive or Tiny tumor on their
      body, usually on their back or stomach. As a standard action, the
      alchemist can have t h e tumor detach itself from their body as a separate
      creature vaguely resembling a kind of animal suitable for a familiar (bat,
      cat, and so on) and move about as if it were an independent creature. The
      tumor can reattach itself to the alchemist as a standard action. The tumor
      has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a batlike
      tumor can fly) and familiar abilities based on the alchemist's caster
      level, gaining DR 5/magic at 7th level in place of speak with animals of
      its kind and increasing that damage resistance by 5 at 13th level in place
      of scry on familiar (these are treated as speak with animals of its kind
      and scry on familiar for the purposes of taking a familiar archetype; if
      speak with animals of its kind is traded but scry on familiar is not, at
      13th level the familiar gains DR 5/magic). The tumor acts as the
      alchemist's familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill
      bonus, the Alertness feat, and so on). When attached to the alchemist, the
      tumor has fast healing 5. An alchemist's extracts and mutagens are
      considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells
      and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be
      replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 100 gp
      per alchemist level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. An alchemist
      can take the Improved Familiar feat with their tumor familiar, treating
      their alchemist level as their arcane spellcaster level.</p>
