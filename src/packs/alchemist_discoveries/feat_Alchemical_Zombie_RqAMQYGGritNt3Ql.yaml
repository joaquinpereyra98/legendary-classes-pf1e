      <p>Prerequisite(s): Alchemist 6th.</p>

      <p>Benefit: The alchemist gains the ability to animate a relatively
      complete corpse as an alchemy-powered zombie. This process takes 1 hour
      and costs 100 gp in alchemical reagents per HD of the corpse being
      animated; the dead creature gains the zombie template. Zombies that are
      created in this manner count as undead created by animate dead for the
      purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. The
      created zombie is a creature, not a supernatural effect. The alchemist
      also gains the Command Undead feat, although they can only use it against
      undead they have created, spending 1 point of quintessence to use this
      feat rather than a use of channel negative energy as well as treating
      their alchemist level as though it was their cleric level and using their
      Intelligence modifier rather than their Charisma modifier to determine its
      effects and DC.</p>

      <p>Special: An alchemist with this discovery can select the Command Undead
      feat a second time; if they do, they can choose to spend quintessence or a
      use of channel negative energy to use that feat, regardless of how the
      undead was created. In addition, they treat their alchemist levels as
      cleric levels to determine their uses of Channel Negative Energy and the
      DC of the Command Undead feat.</p>
