    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Spined mutagen, Alchemist 6th.</p>
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i> 2</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever an
      alchemist with the spined mutagen discovery imbibes a mutagen with that
      discovery applied, their spines grow more dangerous. The alchemist now
      gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, although their unarmed strikes
      deal both piercing and bludgeoning damage, and once per round as a free
      action when the alchemist successfully attacks a feature with their
      unarmed strike, they can choose to break the spines off in a creature. A
      creature who has spines broken off into it takes damage equal to the
      alchemist's Intelligence modifier at the beginning of each of their
      rounds, requiring a move action to remove a spine. </p>
