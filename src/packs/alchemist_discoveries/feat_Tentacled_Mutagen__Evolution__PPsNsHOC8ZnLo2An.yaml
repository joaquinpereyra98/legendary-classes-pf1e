      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 2</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the
      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, they grow a pair
      of tentacles from their body. These tentacles are primary natural attacks
      which deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage (1d3 for small alchemist) but are unable
      to hold or manipulate objects. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If an alchemist
      possesses this discovery, whenever they imbibe any mutagen, they can
      choose to grow a single small tentacle (an alchemist cannot grow more than
      2 tentacles due to this discovery) from their body. This tentacle is a
      secondary natural attack which deals 1d3 bludgeoning damage (1d2 for small
      alchemists). </p>
