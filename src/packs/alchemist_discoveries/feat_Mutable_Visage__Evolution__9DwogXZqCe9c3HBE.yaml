    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i> 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever the
      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, they are treated
      as though under the effects of an <i>alter self</i> spell, although their
      abilities scores are not altered by this ability. The alchemist can spend
      1 additional quintessence when applying this discovery to a mutagen to
      allow themselves to alter their appearance at will as a standard action.
