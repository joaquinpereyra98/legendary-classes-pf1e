    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the
      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, they grow a layer
      of razor sharp spines all over their body. Whenever the alchemist is
      attacked with a non-reach melee attack while covered in spines, the
      attacking creature take damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence
      modifier + 1/2 their alchemist level. In addition, the alchemist can fire
      spines at those around them as though they were a ranged projectile weapon
      with a max range increment of 60 feet. These spines deal 1d6 + the
      alchemist's Intelligence modifier, and for every 5 class levels the
      alchemist possesses, their damage increases by 1d6. Spines fired off by
      this ability instantly regrow. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If an alchemist
      possesses this discovery, whenever they imbibe any mutagen, they can
      choose to grow a lesser set of spines. Whenever the alchemist is attacked
      with a natural attack while covered in lesser spines, the attacking
      creature takes damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. </p>
