    value: >-
      <p>Quintessence Cost: 1</p> <p> Benefit: When an alchemist applies this
      discovery to a toxin, they choose either Strength, Constitution, or
      Dexterity. A creature who fails their saving throw takes a penalty to this
      ability score equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier instead of
      becoming sickened. At 8th level, at the beginning of that creature's next
      turn, the creature must make a Fortitude saving throw. If this saving
      throw is unsuccessful, the creature loses that penalty and takes ability
      damage to that score equal to the penalty they suffered from this effect.
      At 14th level, if the creature fails the saving throw at the beginning of
      their turn, they instead take ability drain to that ability score. </p>
