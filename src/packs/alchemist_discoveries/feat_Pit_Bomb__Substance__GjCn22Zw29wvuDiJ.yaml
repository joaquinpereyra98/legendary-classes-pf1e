      1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can
      choose to have it deal no damage and making no noise, instead no longer
      able to target a creature. A pit bomb must instead target a square, making
      it the target of a <i>create pit</i> spell, using the alchemist's class
      level as their caster level for the purpose of its effects. At 8th level,
      it can instead creates a <i>spiked pit</i> spell. </p>
