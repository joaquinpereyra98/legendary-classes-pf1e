    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the
      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, they gain an
      additional pair of arms, complete with hands. The alchemist does not gain
      any additional natural attacks for an additional pair of arms, but they
      can be used to wield weapons. These limbs have their own “hand” or “ring”
      magic item slots (though the alchemist can still only wear two rings or
      two hand magic items at a time). </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If an alchemist
      possesses this discovery, whenever they imbibe any mutagen, they can
      choose to grow a vestigial arm (this special ability does not allow the
      alchemist to grow a third arm if used with vestigial appendage). </p> <p>
      The arm is fully under their control and cannot be concealed except with
      magic or bulky clothing. The arm does not give the alchemist any extra
      attacks or actions per round, though the arm can wield a weapon and make
      attacks as part of the alchemist's attack routine (using two-weapon
      fighting). The arm can manipulate or hold items as well as the alchemist's
      original arms (for example, allowing the alchemist to use one hand to
      wield a weapon, another hand to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw
      a bomb). </p>
