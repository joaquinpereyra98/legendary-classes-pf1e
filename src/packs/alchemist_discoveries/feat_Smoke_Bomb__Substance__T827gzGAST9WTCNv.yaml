    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can choose to
      have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud
      functions as <i>fog cloud</i>, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's
      splash radius for 1 round per level. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: The
      alchemist can choose to have any bomb they create explode without making
      noise or dealing damage. </p>
