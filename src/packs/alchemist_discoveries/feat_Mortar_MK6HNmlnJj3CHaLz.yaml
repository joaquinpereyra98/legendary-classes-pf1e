      <p> <i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 8th, at least one substance
      discovery, automaton with retort customization or minor customize self
      (retort) </p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: Special; see below</p> <p>
      <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist's automaton uses its retort ability,
      they can spend 1 point of quintessence as a free action, even if it isn't
      their turn, to infuse its projectile with alchemical substances similar to
      their bombs. It may apply the effect of one substance discovery to the
      attack. The retort still does the same amount of damage as normal, but the
      damage type may change and it may have additional effects. If the
      substance discovery has a quintessence cost, the alchemist must pay that
      in addition to the cost of this ability. If the alchemist has the minor
      customize self (retort) discovery, they can apply this to their own
      retorts with the same effect. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If you or your
      automaton have the barrage discovery, you may apply this to the first
      attack you make when you use it, just as if using it with retort. </p>
