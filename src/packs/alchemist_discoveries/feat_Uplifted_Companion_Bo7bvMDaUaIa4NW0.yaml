    value: >-
      <p> <i>Prerequisite(s):</i> A familiar (including a tumor familiar),
      animal companion, or other bonded creature with an intelligence score,
      Alchemist 6th. </p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> The alchemist's familiar, animal
      companion, or other bonded creature with an Intelligence score has its
      Intelligence increased by 8. This does not apply to familiars that do not
      use the normal familiar Intelligence score, such as many familiars
      selected with the Improved Familiar feat. This may grant it additional
      skill points as normal for increases to Intelligence and allow it to
      select different feats. </p> <p> <i>Special:</i> An alchemist may select
      this discovery multiple times, each time choosing a different familiar,
      animal companion, or other bonded creature. </p>
