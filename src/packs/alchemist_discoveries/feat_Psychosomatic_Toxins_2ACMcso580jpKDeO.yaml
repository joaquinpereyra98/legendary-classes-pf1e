      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever an alchemist creates a toxin, they can choose
      for it to require a successful Will saving throw instead of a successful
      Fortitude saving throw (this applies to all saving throws the discovery
      mentions). Toxins with this discovery applied to them are mind-affecting
      effects. </p> <p><b>Special</b>: The alchemist gains 1 additional
      quintessence.</p>
