      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, they gain
      the see in darkness ability as well as being treated as though under the
      effects of a <i>see invisibility</i> spell. At 10th level, the alchemist
      can spend 2 points of quintessence while under the effects of their
      mutagen to gain the effects of a <i>true seeing</i> spell for a number of
      minutes equal to their alchemist level. </p>
