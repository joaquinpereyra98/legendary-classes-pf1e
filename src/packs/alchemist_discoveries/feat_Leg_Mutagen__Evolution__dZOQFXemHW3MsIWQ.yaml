    value: >-
      <p>Quintessence Cost: 1</p> <p> Benefit: Whenever the alchemist imbibes a
      mutagen with this discovery applied, they gain a pair of talon attacks on
      their legs. These are secondary attacks and are made using the alchemist's
      full base attack bonus. The talon attacks deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3
      if the alchemist is Small). In addition, the alchemist gains a climb speed
      of 30 feet which does not require their hands to use and their base land
      speed is increased by 10 feet. For every 4 class levels the alchemist
      possesses, their base land speed and climb speed increase by 10 feet. </p>
      <p> <b>Special</b>: If an alchemist possesses this discovery, whenever
      they imbibe any mutagen, they gain a climb speed of 15 feet. </p>
