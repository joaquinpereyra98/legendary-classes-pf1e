      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Alchemist 8th, alchemical zombie discovery.</p>
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i> 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Until the beginning
      of the alchemist's next round, if a creature is killed by a bomb's damage
      or effect, its corpse is immediately reanimated as an undead creature with
      the skeleton template. Skeletons that are created in this manner count as
      undead created by <i>animate dead</i> for the purposes of determining how
      many undead the alchemist can control. </p>
