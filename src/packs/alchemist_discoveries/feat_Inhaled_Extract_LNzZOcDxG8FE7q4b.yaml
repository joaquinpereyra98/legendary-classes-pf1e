    value: >-
      <p>Prerequisite(s) Alchemist 8th.</p>

      <p>Benefit: The alchemist can store their extracts inside of atomizers,
      rather than bottles or vials, allowing them to spray them at themselves or
      an adjacent ally. The target is considered the imbiber, as if they had
      drank an extract prepared with the infusion discovery. As the contents of
      an atomizer are inhaled, the target must be able to breathe. Atomized
      extracts are considered extracts for purposes of other abilities.</p>

      <p>In addition, the alchemist can also create an inhaled version of an
      extract that is shared among multiple creatures instead of one that is
      imbibed. They must decide that an extract is an inhaled extract when they
      make it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within
      a 10-foot spread of the extract. An inhaled extract expends one of the
      alchemist's daily extracts as if it were an extract 1 level higher (an
      inhaled extract of cure light wounds would be treated as a 2nd-level
      extract when prepared, taking up one of the alchemist's 2nd- level slots).
      This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch.
      Special: If the alchemist has the mutagenic discipline, they can store
      their mutagen inside of atomizers, being able to spray them in the same
      way as they can with extracts.</p>
