    value: >-
      <p> <i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Automaton with major customizations, customize
      self (minor). </p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Choose a major customization. The
      alchemist gains its benefit, but not any increase to armor bonus or
      ability scores it would grant an automaton. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If
      the customization you choose refers to or modifies the automaton's slam
      attack and you do not have one, you may instead treat your unarmed strike
      as if it were a slam for the purposes of that customization. This does not
      give you the ability to make unarmed strikes as if armed. You may select
      this discovery more than once, choosing a different minor customization
      each time. </p>
