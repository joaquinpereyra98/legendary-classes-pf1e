    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 8</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The
      alchemist gains a homunculus familiar, as the arcane bond wizard class
      feature, and can add new abilities for half the normal price and without
      making a Heal check. This does not allow you to have two familiars
      (including a tumor familiar) or a familiar and a bonded item. </p>
