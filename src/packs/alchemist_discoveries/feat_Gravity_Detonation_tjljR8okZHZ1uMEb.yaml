      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Void Bomb</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever the
      alchemist creates a void bomb, they can choose to instead create a gravity
      bomb. The target takes damage as if hit by a void bomb. All other
      creatures within 5 feet of the target are subject to a bull rush. The
      alchemist uses their alchemist class level in place of their Combat
      Maneuver Bonus and adds their Intelligence modifier in place of their
      Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the bull rush attempts.
      Creatures moved by a gravity bomb are pushed directly away from the
      target's square. </p>
