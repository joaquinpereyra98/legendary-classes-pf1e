  description:
    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When the alchemist creates an extract, they can place
      two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae
      take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the
      highest-level formulae placed in the extract (if the alchemist combined a
      <i>cure light wounds</i> and <i>invisibility</i> spell, it would require a
      4th-level extract slot). </p>
