  description:
    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the alchemist makes an attack action, they
      can apply a bomb to their weapon or a piece of ammunition. On a successful
      attack, it deals additional damage equal to the bomb's splash damage and
      is treated as a direct hit for the purpose of any substance infusion
      applied to it. If the attack is unsuccessful, the applied bomb becomes
      inert at the end of their round. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: The alchemist
      can only apply [substance] discoveries which trigger on a direct hit with
      this discovery. </p>
