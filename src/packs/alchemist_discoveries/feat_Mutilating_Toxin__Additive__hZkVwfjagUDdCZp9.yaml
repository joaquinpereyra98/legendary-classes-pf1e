  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 8th.</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The
      damage dealt by the alchemist's toxin cannot be healed by magic but only
      through natural healing. </p> <p> (<i>Editor's Note:</i> Mutilating Toxin
      originally had "Destructive Toxin" as a prerequisite. Destructive Toxin
      was removed during development when the toxin of the toxicologist was
      changed to innately deal damage. Thus, I have removed the non-existent
      prerequisite.) </p>
