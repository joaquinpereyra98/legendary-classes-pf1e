      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Alchemist 6th.</p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i>
      2</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When an alchemist applies this discovery to a
      toxin, a creature who fails their saving throw is treated as though under
      the effects of a <i>bestow curse</i> spell, the effect of the curse being
      chosen upon applying this discovery to a toxin. Unlike other toxins, this
      effect is permanent until removed. This is a supernatural curse effect.
