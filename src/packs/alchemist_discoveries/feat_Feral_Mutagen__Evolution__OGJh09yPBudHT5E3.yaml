    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the
      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, they gain two
      claw attacks on a pair of hands of their choice. These are primary attacks
      and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw
      attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small). While
      the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on
      Intimidate skill checks. In addition, the alchemist gains a burrow speed
      of 20 feet. For every 3 class levels the alchemist possesses, their
      competence bonus on Intimidate checks increases by +2 and their burrow
      speed increases by 5 feet. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If an alchemist
      possesses this discovery, whenever they imbibe any mutagen, they gain a
      burrow speed of 10 feet. </p>
