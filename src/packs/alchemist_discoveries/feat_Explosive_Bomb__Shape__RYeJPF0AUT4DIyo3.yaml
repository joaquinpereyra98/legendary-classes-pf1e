    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10
      feet rather than 5 feet (see Throw Splash Weapon). At 8th level, they can
      instead increase the splash range to 20 feet. At 16th level, they can
      instead increase the splash radius to 30 feet. </p> <p><b>Special</b>: The
      alchemist gains 1 additional quintessence.</p>
