      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 10th.</p> <p><i>Quintessence
      Cost</i>: 2</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When an alchemist applies this
      discovery to a toxin, a creature who fails their saving throw is treated
      as though they had just failed a Constitution check while suffocating,
      reducing their hit points to 0. At the beginning of each of that
      creature's turns, as long as they are under the effects of the toxin, they
      must make a successful saving throw; each failed saving throw is treated
      as a failed Constitution check, causing the creature to be reduced to -1
      hit points and suffocating respectively. </p>
