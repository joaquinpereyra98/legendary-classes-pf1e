    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Select one creature type; the alchemist's toxins
      ignore any immunity that creature type may possess to poison effects. At
      4th level and every four levels afterwards, they can select an additional
      creature type. They can instead choose to select the same creature type a
      second time, causing those creatures to take a -2 penalty to saving throws
      against the alchemist's toxins. </p>
