    value: >-
      <p>Prerequisite(s): Vestigial appendages.</p>

      <p>Benefit: The alchemist's vestigial arms are part of a parasitic twin on
      their torso, consisting of a head, a torso, and two arms (from the
      vestigial arm discovery). Normally, the twin is mostly recessed within the
      alchemist's body, with the visible arms acting like the vestigial
      appendages discovery, though the alchemist can manifest or hide the twin
      as a full round action. The twin is helpless, fully subservient to the
      alchemist, and cannot be targeted or harmed. A number of times per day
      equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier, if the alchemist succumbs
      to a non-harmless mind affecting effect, they can reroll their saving
      throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and the alchemist can
      ignore it. The alchemist can use this ability even if they have run out of
      uses, but each use of this ability cost 1 quintessence.</p>
