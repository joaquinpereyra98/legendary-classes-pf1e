    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i> 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever the
      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, they gain a +5
      circumstance on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks on living
      creatures within 60 feet. As long as the alchemist is within 30 feet of a
      creature, they can target that creature with their pheromones, treating
      them as the target of a <i>charm person</i> spell; the DC of this
      discovery is 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's class level + their Intelligence
      modifier. A creature can only be targeted by this discovery once per day
      but is unaware they were targeted even if they successfully save against
      this discovery. At 10th level, the alchemist can spend 1 point of
      quintessence while targeting a creature, instead treating them as the
      target of a <i>charm monster</i> spell, although it retains the same
      duration as <i>charm person</i>. </p>
