    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist
      creates a bomb, they can choose to have it create a grease slick upon
      detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the
      bomb's splash radius in grease (as the grease spell) for 1 round per
      level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling after a failed
      Acrobatics check is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the
      alchemist's Intelligence modifier. A grease bomb can't affect items or
      armor. </p>
