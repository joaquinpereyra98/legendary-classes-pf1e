      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When an alchemist
      applies this discovery to a toxin, it no longer deals damage or sickens a
      creature. Instead, the creature gains a number of temporary hit points
      equal to the alchemist's class level + their Intelligence modifier which
      last for a number of minutes equal to their Intelligence modifier. At 10th
      level, they instead gain temporary hit points equal to two times the
      alchemist's class level + their Intelligence modifier, and last for a
      number of hours equal to their Intelligence modifier. </p>
