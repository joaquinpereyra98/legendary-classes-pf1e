    value: >-
      <p>Benefit: Starting at 2nd level, an alchemist adds 1/2 their alchemist
      level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on Disable Device
      checks. An alchemist can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. As a
      full-round action, an alchemist can make a ranged touch attack against a
      trap using an alchemist's fire or acid, using the trap's Disable Device DC
      as its AC. If the attack misses, the trap activates. If the attack hits,
      the bomb deactivates the trap without setting it off. The alchemist must
      both know the location of the trap and be able to reach the trap's trigger
      with a ranged touch attack in order to use this ability. At 6th level, an
      alchemist can disarm magic traps with this ability.</p>
