      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can choose to
      have it be unable target a creature, instead targeting a single square and
      only dealing splash damage. The bomb creates a puddle in its splash radius
      for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's intelligence bonus
      (minimum 1). Each creature which starts its turn within this area takes
      damage equal to the bomb's splash damage. A creature caught in the puddle
      when it is first created can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. If the
      alchemist is adjacent to this puddle, they can remove its effects from 1
      square as a free action. </p>
