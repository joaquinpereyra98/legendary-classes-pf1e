      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Alchemist 6th.</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> The
      alchemist gains the ability to create a duplicate body for themselves out
      of iron and metal; creating a duplicate costs 500 gp in alchemical
      materials and requires 1 day to create. The duplicate is a perfect
      recreation of the alchemist's original body. As a full-round action, the
      alchemist can shift their consciousness from their current body to any one
      of their available duplicates, which must be on the same plane as the
      alchemist. While in the duplicate, the alchemist retains all abilities not
      related to their body (such as natural attacks). If killed in a duplicate,
      the alchemist transfers to their own body automatically; if killed in
      their own body, they are dead. Unused duplicates (including their
      abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses. </p>
