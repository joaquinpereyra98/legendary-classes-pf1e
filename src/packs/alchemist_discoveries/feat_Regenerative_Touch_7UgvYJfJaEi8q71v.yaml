      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Natural regeneration, Alchemist 6th.</p> <p>
      <i>Benefit:</i> As a move or swift action, the alchemist may touch a
      creature and apply 1 round's effect of their natural regeneration
      discovery to that creature; this counts toward their spontaneous healing
      limit for the day. At 10th level, this can be done as a free action once
      per round and is not limited to 1 round's worth of their natural
      regeneration discovery's limit, instead being able to heal up to 20 hit
      points per use (this removal of limitation also applies for how much the
      alchemist can heal from their natural regeneration discovery each round).
