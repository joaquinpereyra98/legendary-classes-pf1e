  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Benefit: The alchemist can grow up to two arms on their torso. These
      arms are fully under their control and cannot be concealed except with
      magic or bulky clothing, although they can be retracted into the
      alchemist's body as a full round action, requiring another full round
      action to summon them from their body. These arms do not give the
      alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, though the arms can
      wield a weapon and make attacks as part of the alchemist's attack routine
      (using two-weapon fighting). The arms can manipulate or hold items as well
      as the alchemist's original arms (for example, allowing the alchemist to
      use one hand to wield a weapon, another hand to hold a potion, and a third
      hand to throw a bomb). The arms has their own “hand” and “ring” magic item
      slots (though the alchemist can still only wear two rings and two hand
      magic items at a time).</p>
