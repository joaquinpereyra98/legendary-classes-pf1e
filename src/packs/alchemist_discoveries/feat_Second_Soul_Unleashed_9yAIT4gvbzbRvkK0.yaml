      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Parasitic twin discovery, alchemist 10th.</p>
      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, they can
      choose to allow their parasitic twin to take control of their body and
      reduces the action needed to imbibe their mutagen by 1 step (from standard
      to move or from move to swift). Doing so reduces the quintessence cost of
      any discovery they apply to their mutagen by 1 (to a minimum of 0) except
      for dual evolution, as the parasitic twin uses its own secret reserves of
      quintessence to power the transformation. While under the effects of their
      mutagen, while in combat, the alchemist must roll 1d100; on a roll of 20
      or higher, they are in full control of their actions and may act normally.
      On a roll of 19 or lower, the parasitic twin decides their actions (as
      decided by the GM); the parasitic twin is partial to violence and melee
      attacks and will never use consumables or items with limited charges
      during actions in which it is dominant. Outside of combat, the parasitic
      twin will be generally agreeable and curious, although it can be quick to
      anger. While dominant, the parasitic twin is treated as a unique creature
      rather than being treated as the alchemist for the purpose of effects
      which would target a specific creature. </p> <p> After 10 minutes, the
      alchemist can spend 1 quintessence as a full-round action to suppress the
      parasitic twin, forcing its consciousness to become dormant again. All
      mind affecting effects currently active at that time are instantly ended,
      and the alchemist can force their parasitic twin to become dormant even if
      the parasitic twin is not in control of its actions, such as due to being
      dominated or confused. </p> <table class="article-table"> <caption>
      <b>Parasitic Twin Outside Of Combat</b> </caption> <tbody> <tr> <td> While
      the theme of the discovery is the parasitic twin being its own creature,
      it is suggested that the GM allow the player to play out this character
      themselves, giving them a unique chance to roleplay as a different
      character in a way. Allow the player to develop this parasitic twin
      however they wish, letting it engage the world with its limited
      understanding. It could be a great opportunity for a player to develop a
      unique relationship with their parasitic twin, changing it from a simple
      class feature into a robust facet of their character which is every bit as
      important as a familiar, mount, or other such creature. <p> While a
      parasitic twin and its host may be the best of friends, this should not
      remove the d100 roll each round of combat. Treat this as the parasitic
      twin asserting its own autonomy in a body it so rarely is allowed to
      control. </p> <p> <br> While the GM should step in if they feel the player
      is abusing this discovery, this should be a last resort. Allow the player
      as much freedom as possible to customize this parasitic twin, and consider
      the following sources of inspiration for the origin of the parasitic twin:
      </p> <ul> <li>A sibling who was lost in the womb</li> <li>The spirit of a
      companion who was lost in combat</li> <li>A departed loved one</li> <li>A
      version of the character from another dimension</li> <li>A party member
      who died</li> <li>A repressed concept of who the character wants to
      be</li> </ul> <p> These are only suggestions, there are many different
      ways to customize a parasitic twin, so feel free to explore this concept
      to enrich your roleplaying experience. Consider even giving a way for the
      parasitic twin to free itself from its host's body! </p> </td> </tr>
