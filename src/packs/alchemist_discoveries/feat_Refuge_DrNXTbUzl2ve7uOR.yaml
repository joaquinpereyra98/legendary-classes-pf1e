    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite</i>: Tinker discipline.</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When
      the alchemist is reduced below 0 HP while within 100 feet of their
      automaton, they may choose to have their spirit flee their body and
      inhabit their automaton, even if they would have been killed. Their body
      is reduced to dust, but the automaton survives and begins creating a new
      body for the alchemist, which is complete in 1d10+1 days. During this time
      the alchemist may take no actions except to command the automaton and does
      not have quintessence, and if the automaton is destroyed the alchemist
      dies. </p>
