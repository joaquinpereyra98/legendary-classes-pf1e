  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 2</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the
      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, their physical
      form becomes soft and rubbery, like an ooze. The alchemist is treated as
      two sizes smaller for the purpose of squeezing through tight spaces and
      can convert an amount of damage equal to their Intelligence modifier taken
      from any source into non-lethal damage (if the alchemist is immune to
      non-lethal damage, this ability does not function) and gains blindsense 30
      feet. In addition, they can choose to secrete acid as a free action (being
      able to end this effect as a free action), causing their natural weapons
      to deal an amount of acid damage equal to their Intelligence modifier;
      this acid does not damage anything they wear. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If
      an alchemist possesses this discovery, whenever they imbibe any mutagen,
      they can choose to take on a vaguely oozelike appearance, gaining
      blindsense 30 feet. </p>
