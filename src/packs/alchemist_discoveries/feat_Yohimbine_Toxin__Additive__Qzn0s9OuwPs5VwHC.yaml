    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 4th.</p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>:
      1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When an alchemist applies this discovery to a
      toxin, a creature who fails their saving throw is shaken instead of
      becoming sickened. If the creature is shaken at the beginning of their
      next turn, they must make a Will saving throw. If they fail this saving
      throw, they are instead frightened. At 10th level, if the creature fails
      this Will saving throw, they are instead panicked. </p>
