  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: A creature that
      takes a direct hit from a tangling bomb must save against the bomb's DC or
      be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a
      tanglefoot bag (a tangling bomb affects creatures regardless of their
      size). Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled
      but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at
      all. </p>
