  description:
    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When an alchemist applies this discovery to a toxin,
      any creature affected by that toxin can choose to enter a state of fake
      death rather than being sickened and taking damage, appearing to be dead
      (if an unwilling target is affected, this toxin has no effect). This
      effect makes them appear to be dead to all methods of detection including
      magic. The creature cannot see, but is otherwise aware of their
      surroundings, and can spend 1 full-round action to rouse themselves back
      to life. This toxin lasts for 24 hours, after which the creature is
      automatically brought back to life. At 10th level, this toxin instead
      lasts for 1 week. </p> <p> <i>Special:</i> An alchemist with this
      discovery gains a +4 alchemical bonus to saving throws against death
      effects and can use the effect of this discovery without applying it to a
      poison as an immediate reaction as long as they have been dealt damage
      within 1 round and have this toxin on their person. </p>
