      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Delayed detonation discovery.</p> <p>
      <i>Benefit:</i> The alchemist can implant a bomb in a willing or helpless
      creature (a mindless creature under their control, such as a zombie,
      counts as willing for this purpose); this takes 1 hour. When the implanted
      creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square
      as if it were a delayed bomb set by the alchemist (though they can set the
      bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). The alchemist can use
      any [substance] discoveries on this implanted bomb but not [shape]
      discoveries. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after it is
      implanted it in the creature. </p> <p> The alchemist can spend 3 points of
      quintessence when using this discovery, if they do, the bomb does not
      automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature
      dies or is destroyed. The alchemist can only have a number of creatures
      implanted with bombs equal to their Intelligence modifier at once. </p>
      <p> Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat
      deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by
      magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures
      (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality)
      cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a
      Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell
      or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC = 11 + alchemistâ€˜s
      caster level). </p>
