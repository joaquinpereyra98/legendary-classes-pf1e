      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 4th, bomb class feature.</p>
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: Whenever the
      alchemist creates a bomb, they can apply a toxin to it. If the bomb lands
      a direct hit against a creature, that creature is exposed to the toxin and
      forced to make a saving throw against it. All creatures who take splash
      damage from this bomb must also make a saving throw against it, but gain a
      +4 bonus to their saving throws. </p>
