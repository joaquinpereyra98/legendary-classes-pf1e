    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against an
      ingested toxin the alchemist created, for the next 24 hours, the next
      creature to come into physical contact with who failed that saving throw
      is treated as though they were exposed to that toxin, despite it being
      ingested. </p>
