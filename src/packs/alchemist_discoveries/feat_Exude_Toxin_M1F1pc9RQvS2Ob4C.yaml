    value: >-
      <p> <i>Prerequisite</i>: Alchemist 8, toxicologist discipline, automaton
      with exude substance customization. </p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist
      may infuse a toxin into their automaton in place of an alchemical
      substance. Doing so consumes a toxin, but the toxin counts against the
      total number of toxins the alchemist may possess at one time until the
      automaton uses it. The automaton may then apply the toxin to its slam
      attack as a move action. </p>
