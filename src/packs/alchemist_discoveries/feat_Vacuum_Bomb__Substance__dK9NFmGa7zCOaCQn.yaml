      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can choose to
      have it be unable target a creature, instead targeting a single square and
      only dealing splash damage. All creatures within 15 feet of that square
      except for allies must make a successful Reflex saving throw or be pulled
      10 feet towards the square. If two or more creatures would enter the same
      square because of this discovery, they take damage equal to two times the
      alchemist's Intelligence modifier and must make a successful Reflex saving
      throw or fall prone in the space they currently occupy. </p> <p>
      <b>Special</b>: If the explosion would target more than one square (such
      as due to applying a [shape] discovery to it), the alchemist selects any
      square in the bomb's blast radius as the targeted square. </p> <p>
      <b>Special</b>: The alchemist can choose to have any bomb they create
      explode without making noise or dealing damage. </p>
