    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can infuse it
      with rotting materials. Creatures that take a direct hit from a rotten
      bomb are sickened for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's
      Intelligence modifier unless they succeed at Fortitude saves. </p>
