      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 4th</p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>:
      1</p> <p> When an alchemist applies this discovery to a toxin, a creature
      who fails their saving throw treats all creatures as though they have
      concealment instead of becoming sickened. At 8th level, the creature is
      instead blinded. </p>
