      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist prepares an extract they may choose
      to infuse it into their automaton. (The automaton must be present while
      the alchemist prepares the extract.) The alchemist cannot use this extract
      or give it to another creature to use, but as long as their automaton is
      within 100 feet they may cause their automaton to be affected by it as a
      standard action. Extracts infused into an automaton expire after one day
      as normal. </p>
