      <p>Benefit: All extracts the alchemist prepares which have the word ‘cure'
      or ‘heal' in their name (such as cure light wounds) can be imbibed as a
      move action rather than a standard action. In addition, a creature that
      imbibes a ‘cure' extract created by the alchemist can treat any d8 rolled
      as a 5 when determining how much the extract heals them.</p>
