    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Delayed Detonation.</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> The
      alchemist can spend 1 minute to create a trap with their bomb against a
      solid surface, obscuring it from view. A creature who is unaware of this
      trap must make a successful Perception check (DC 10 + the alchemist's
      class level + their Intelligence modifier) to spot it. When a creature
      enters a square containing this trap, it explodes, dealing normal bomb
      damage to all creatures in its square (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's class
      level + their Intelligence modifier; Reflex half ) and splash damage to
      every creature adjacent to that square. This trap can be disarmed with a
      successful Disable Device check (with a DC equal to the trap's save DC);
      otherwise, it lasts until the next time the alchemist refreshes their
      daily bombs. When the alchemist uses this discovery, they can designate a
      number of allies up to their Intelligence modifier, allowing the
      designated allies to pass safely through the trap's square without causing
      it to detonate. If another creature triggers the trip mine while an ally
      is nearby, the ally still takes damage as normal. </p>
