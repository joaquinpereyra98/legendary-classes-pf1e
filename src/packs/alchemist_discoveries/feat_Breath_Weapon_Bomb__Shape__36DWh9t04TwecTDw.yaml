  description:
    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and
      throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix
      them within their body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as an
      attack action (if the alchemist has the ability to throw multiple bombs,
      they may use this discovery with each bomb they would be able to throw).
      This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone or 30-foot line and has the same DC
      as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had
      suffered a direct hit from the alchemist's bomb but succeeding at a Reflex
      save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent
      modifier) halves the damage. Drawing, drinking, and expelling breath
      weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 10th level, this
      instead becomes a 30-foot cone or 60-foot line. </p>
