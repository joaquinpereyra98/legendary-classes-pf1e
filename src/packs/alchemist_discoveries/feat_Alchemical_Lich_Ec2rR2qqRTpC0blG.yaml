  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Mummification.</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> The
      alchemist gains the lich template, ignoring its requirements, and uses
      their Intelligence modifier in place of their Charisma to determine their
      hit points as well as the saving throws of any ability gained from this
      template. Unlike a normal lich, an alchemical lich does not need to be
      evil, being able to be any alignment they desire. An alchemical lich is
      treated as a living creature for the purposes of any extract they create
      whenever it would benefit them. The can also cause their melee touch
      attack to deal damage equal to their bombs, as well as apply any discovery
      they possess to it as long as it would not change the area of the bomb
      (although they must still pay any quintessence cost associated with it);
      they cannot use this ability when using their touch attack to heal a
      creature. Upon selecting this discovery, the alchemist automatically gains
      a phylactery. </p>
