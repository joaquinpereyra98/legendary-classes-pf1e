      alchemist imbibes a mutagen with this discovery applied, their natural

      4 quintessence when applying this discovery to a mutagen to instead
      increase their natural reach by 10 feet. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>: If an
      alchemist possesses this discovery, whenever they imbibe any mutagen, they
      can spend a swift action to increase their natural reach by 5 feet until
      the end of their turn. </p>
