    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist
      creates a bomb, they can choose to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures
      that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered for a number of
      rounds equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier unless they succeed
      on a Fortitude save. </p>
