    value: >-
      <p>Benefits: When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the
      alchemist, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is
      negated and damage is instead rolled normally. In addition, they treat
      their Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of
      determining when hit point damage kills them (so an alchemist with a
      Constitution of 10 and this discovery dies at –20 hit points instead of
      –10). Reducing him to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability
      damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes them
      unconscious and comatose, but they are only killed after taking an
      additional 5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect,
      the alchemist must be brought to –5 Constitution in order to be killed by
      these attacks).</p>

      <p>Special: This does stack with similar abilities that negate critical
      hits and sneak attacks (such as fortification armor). An alchemist can
      take this discovery up to three times; the effects stack, increasing this
      chance to 50% and then 75% as well as treating their Constitution as
      though it was 20 and 30 points higher and requiring them to be brought to
      -10 and -15 Constitution in order to be killed.</p>
