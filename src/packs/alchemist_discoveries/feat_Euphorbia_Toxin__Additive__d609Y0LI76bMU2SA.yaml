    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 2</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When an alchemist
      applies this discovery to a toxin, a creature who fails their saving throw
      is <i>fatigued</i> instead of becoming <i>sickened</i>. If the creature is
      fatigued at the beginning of their next turn, they must make a Fortitude
      saving throw. If they fail this saving throw, they are instead
      <i>staggered</i> for 1 minute. At 10th level, if the creature fails this
      saving throw, they instead lose consciousness and fall asleep for a number
      of hours equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Slapping or
      wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
      Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid
      another action). </p>
