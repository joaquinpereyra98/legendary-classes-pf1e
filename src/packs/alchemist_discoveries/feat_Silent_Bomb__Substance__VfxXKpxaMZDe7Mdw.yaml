  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist
      creates a bomb, they can choose for it to silence all creatures it damages
      as though under the effects of a <i>silence</i> spell for a number of
      minutes equal to their Intelligence modifier unless the damaged creatures
      make a successful Will saving throw. All spaces that would take splash
      damage from this bomb are automatically silenced. </p> <p> <b>Special</b>:
      The alchemist can choose to have any bomb they create explode without
      making noise or dealing damage. </p>
