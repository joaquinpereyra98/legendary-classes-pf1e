  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 8</p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>:
      2</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can
      choose for it to detonate very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit
      from a blinding bomb are blinded for a number of rounds equal to the
      alchemist's Intelligence modifier unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.
      Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are
      dazzled for 1 minute. This is a light effect. </p> <p><br></p>
