    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When an alchemist applies this discovery to a toxin, a
      creature who fails their saving throw is unable to create new memories for
      the next 8 hours in addition to any other effects of discoveries applied
      to the toxin. All events which occur within that time will be forgotten by
      them, unable to be recovered through natural means. In addition, all Bluff
      checks made about the forgotten time gain a +6 circumstance bonus due to
      the creature's hazy recollection. </p>
