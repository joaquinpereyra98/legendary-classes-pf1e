      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: If a creature damaged by this bomb is rendered
      unconscious within 1 minute, that creature loses all memory from the last
      hour and cannot form new memories for 8 hours. </p> <p> The lost and
      prevented memories might return later as dreams, and can be restored with
      a <i>restoration</i> spell. </p>
