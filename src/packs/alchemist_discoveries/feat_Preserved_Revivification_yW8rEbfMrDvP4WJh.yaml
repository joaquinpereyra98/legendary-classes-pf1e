      <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i> 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> As a full-round
      action, an alchemist can expend a 1st-level extract they have prepared to
      create a creature, as <i>summon monster I</i>, using their level as the
      spell's caster level. The extract is expended as if the alchemist had
      consumed it. The alchemist can expend a higher-level extract when using
      this ability to create a creature using a <i>summon monster</i> spell of a
      level equal to the level of extract expended. For example, if the
      alchemist expends a 4th- level extract, they can create a creature as if
      using <i>summon monster IV</i>. At 6th level and every six levels
      afterwards, they can spend an additional point of quintessence to increase
      the level of the summoned monster by 1 (an 18th level alchemist could
      spend 4 points of quintessence and expend a 6th-level extract to create a
      creature as though using <i>summon monster IX</i>). </p>
