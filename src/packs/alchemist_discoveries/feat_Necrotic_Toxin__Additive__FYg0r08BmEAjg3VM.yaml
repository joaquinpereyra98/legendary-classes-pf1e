      Cost:</i> 2</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When an alchemist applies this
      discovery to a toxin, a creature who fails their saving throw gains 2
      negative levels instead of becoming sickened; these negative levels last
      are permanent. At 18th level, the amount of negative levels gained from
      this increases by 2. </p>
