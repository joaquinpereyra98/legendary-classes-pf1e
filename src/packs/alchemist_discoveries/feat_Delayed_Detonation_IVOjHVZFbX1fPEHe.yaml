  description:
    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a
      number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This
      delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a
      number of rounds equal to their level. If at any point the alchemist
      reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, they can end the timer and
      prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any
      other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are
      removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage
      as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb
      when it detonates, and splash damage (see Throw Splash Weapon) to all
      adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one
      delayed bomb at one time. If they create another delayed bomb, the
      previous bomb becomes inert. <i>Dispel magic</i> can neutralize a delayed
      bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the
      alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier). </p>
