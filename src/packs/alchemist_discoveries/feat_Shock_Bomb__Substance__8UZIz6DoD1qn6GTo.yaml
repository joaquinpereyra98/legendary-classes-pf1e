  description:
    value: >-
      <p> <i>Benefit</i>: When the alchemist creates a bomb, they can choose to
      have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from
      a shock bomb are dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's
      level and must make a successful Reflex save or be fatigued for 1 round.
