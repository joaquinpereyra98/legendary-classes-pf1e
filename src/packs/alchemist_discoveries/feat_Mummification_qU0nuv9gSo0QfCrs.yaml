    value: >-
      <p>Prerequisite(s): Preserved organs, alchemist 10th.</p>

      <p>Benefit: After learning this discovery, the alchemist must spend a day
      in preparation which involves doing nothing except drinking a mildly
      poisonous alchemical tea. At the end of this preparation, they fall
      unconscious for 24 hours, then awaken as a “living mummy.” The alchemist's
      type does not change, but they become immune to cold, nonlethal damage,
      paralysis, and sleep and their fortification increases by 25% (to a
      maximum of 100%).</p>
