    value: >-
      <p><i>Prerequisite(s)</i>: Alchemist 8.</p> <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>:
      2</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist's bombs twist the target's
      perception of friend and foe. A creature that takes a direct hit from a
      confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb is confused for 1 minute (the
      confusion effect takes place after damage is dealt) unless they make a
      successful Will save. </p>
