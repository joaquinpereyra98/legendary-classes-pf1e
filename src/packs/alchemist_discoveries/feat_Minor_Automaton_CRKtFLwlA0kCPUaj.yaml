      <p><i>Quintessence Cost</i>: 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit</i>: The alchemist can
      create a minor automaton with 10 minutes of work. This functions as unseen
      servant, with the following modifications. It is not invisible and is
      treated as a tiny object. Like an automaton, it may have almost any
      appearance its creator wishes. It may be attacked and has 4 HP. It has any
      movement modes the alchemist's automaton does, but its speed is never more
      than 15 feet It falls apart and ceases to function if it goes more than
      100 feet away from the alchemist. The alchemist may have a single minor
      automaton at a time, plus an additional minor automaton at 6th, 12th, and
      18th level. If the alchemist creates any minor automata beyond this limit,
      the oldest automaton falls apart and ceases to function. </p>
