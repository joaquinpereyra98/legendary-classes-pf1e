      <p><i>Prerequisite(s):</i> Alchemist 10th.</p> <p><i>Quintessence
      Cost:</i> 3</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When an alchemist applies this
      discovery to a toxin, a creature who fails their saving throw is shaken
      instead of becoming sickened. At the beginning of each of that creature's
      turns, as long as they are under the effects of the toxin, they must make
      a successful saving throw or become permanently petrified. </p>
