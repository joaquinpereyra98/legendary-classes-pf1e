      <p><i>Quintessence Cost:</i> 1</p> <p> <i>Benefit:</i> When an alchemist
      applies this discovery to a toxin, choose either Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma. A creature who fails their saving throw takes a penalty to this
      ability score equal to their Intelligence modifier instead of becoming
      sickened. At 8th level, at the beginning of that creature's next turn,
      they must make a Fortitude saving throw. If this saving throw is
      unsuccessful, the creature loses that penalty and takes ability damage to
      that score equal to the penalty they suffered from this effect. At 14th
      level, if the creature fails the saving throw at the beginning of their
      turn, they instead take ability drain to that ability score. </p>
