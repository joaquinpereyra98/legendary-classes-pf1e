  description:
    value: |-
      <p>A toxicologist alchemist can have a number of poisons or toxins absorbed into themselves equal to their Intelligence modifier. In addition, they can apply poison or toxins (including absorbed poison and toxins) to a weapon as a free action once per round; they can instead spend a swift action to do this. If they do so, the poison or toxinâ€™s DC is increased by +2. A toxicologist alchemist can also metabolize a poison as a swift action.</p>
