      <p>A toxicologist alchemist can create a variety of toxins, a special type of poison like tools. Doing so costs 1 point of quintessence and 10 minutes to create a number of toxins equal to the toxicologist alchemist’s Intelligence modifier, each toxin being placed inside of a vial or other similar receptacle that is not exposed to open air. A toxicologist alchemist can never possess an amount of toxins greater than their Intelligence modifier, and toxins remain potent for 24 hours before becoming inert, although they become inert 1 round after being exposed to open air. The toxicologist alchemist can prevent this by applying it to a weapon; drawing and applying a toxin to a weapon can be done as a move action, the toxin remaining active for a number of rounds equal to the toxicologist alchemist’s Intelligence modifier (this can be done by characters with the Use Poison class feature). a character without the use poison or poisoner class feature cannot apply a toxin to a weapon, automatically exposing themselves to the poison when attempting to do so. Due to the toxicologist alchemist’s bond with their toxins, they are always aware if a creature within 60 feet of themselves has failed a saving throw against their toxins.</p>
      <p>When a toxin is created, the toxicologist alchemist can decide the method in which the toxin is delivered, being either inhaled, contact, or digested. When inside of their vials, thrown toxins have a range of 30 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack, lasting for 1 round before evaporating into harmless smoke, and a thrown toxin covers a 5 foot square. The toxicologist alchemist can modify their poisons with [additive] discoveries, causing the effects of the toxin to change accordingly; these discoveries are applied when the toxin is created.</p>
      <p>The toxicologist alchemist is immune to their own toxin unless they decide otherwise upon creating it, but any creature exposed to this toxin (according to its type) must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s class level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the toxicologist alchemist’s Intelligence modifier and is sickened for 1 minute, and the toxicologist alchemist can decide to create a toxin which does not deal damage. A creature can only be exposed to a single toxin from a toxicologist alchemist each round (multiple toxicologist alchemists can affect the same creature in a round); if a creature is exposed to additional toxins in the same round, they are unaffected by it. This is a poison effect.</p>
      <p>At 6th level, a toxicologist can apply a toxin to a weapon as a swift action and a toxin applied to a weapon remains active for a number of minutes equal to the toxicologist alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. At 12th level, a toxicologist alchemist can apply two [additive] talents to a single toxin, each requiring their own successful saving throw to avoid their effects (if the toxins require saving throws). At 18th level, the toxicologist alchemist can select a single [additive] talent applied to their toxin, a creature who successfully makes a saving throw against that toxin must make an additional saving throw against that discovery at the beginning of their next turn; passing this additional saving throw does not force them to make another saving throw against that poison.</p>
