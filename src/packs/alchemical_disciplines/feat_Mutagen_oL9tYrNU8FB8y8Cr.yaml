  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a mutagenic alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that they can
      imbibe in order to heighten their physical prowess at the cost of their personality.
      The mutagenic alchemist must spend 1 point of quintessence and 10 minutes to brew a
      dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until 24 hours have passed,
      becoming inert after that. A mutagenic alchemist can create as many mutagens as they
      wish at a time, allowing them to create backups. A mutagen that is not in an
      alchemist’s possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again.</p>
      <p>When a mutagenic alchemist brews a mutagen, they select one physical ability
      score—either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It’s a standard action to drink a
      mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the mutagenic alchemist to grow
      bulkier and more bestial, granting them a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical
      bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level.</p>
      <p>A non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain
      the effects of another alchemist’s mutagen if they drink it. (Although if the other
      alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately
      cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever a mutagenic alchemist drinks a
      mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.</p>
      <p>At 10th level, the mutagenic alchemist’s mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor
      bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or
      Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. At 16th
      level, the mutagenic alchemist’s mutagen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8
      alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6
      alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a
      third physical ability score.</p>
