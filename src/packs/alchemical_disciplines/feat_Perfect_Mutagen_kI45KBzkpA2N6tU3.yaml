  description:
    value: |-
      <p>A mutagenic alchemist reduces the cost of their mutagen to 0 (applying enduring mutagen still requires them to spend 1 point of quintessence), although they can only have a number of mutagens active equal to their Intelligence modifier. In addition, they reduce the quintessence cost of their of all [evolution] discoveries by 1 (to a minimum of 1). While under the effects of their mutagen, if the mutagenic alchemist makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, they instead avoid the effect entirely.</p>
